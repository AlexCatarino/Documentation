<p>
TensorFlow is a low level library that we can use to implement machine learning algorithms. Unlike scikit, TensorFlow does not have any ready to use algorithms, Instead, TensorFlow provides the building blocks to implement the algorithms we need. TensorFlow is especially great for implement deep learning algorithms and working with large datasets, since it allows us to take advantage of GPU's for training our models.
