<h4>Creating, editing, and running cells.</h4>
<p>
The notebook allows you to run code in a safe and disposable environment. It is composed of independent cells where code can be edited and executed. The notebook also allows you to provide descriptions of code with supplementary cells written in MarkDown.
</p>
<p>
You can create a new cell by either double-clicking below an existing cell or by using the new cell button on the toolbar. 
</p>
<p>
Each cell can be edited with either markdown or python code. You can choose which language to use in the toolbar module.
</p>
<p>
To run an individual cell, you must first select that cell using either your cursor or arrow keys. Then you can click the run button on the toolbar.
