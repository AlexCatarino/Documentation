QuantConnect provides data from QuantQuote for over 8000 equities going back as far as 1998. The data is available in tick, second, minute, hour, and daily resolution. By default the data is adjusted for dividends and splits.

<h4> Making history calls </h4>
<p>
The history call requires you to pass in the symbols you wish to retrieve data for, and the period and resolution of the data. 
There are three different ways to make a history call:
Time Period + Resolution,
Bar Period + Resolution,
Start Time + End Time + Resolution
</p>

<h4>Accessing and manipulating data</h4>
<p>
The dataframe returned will have a column for each data type available. For equities, the dataframe will have a column for Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume data since equity quote data is not yet available. The rows are first indexed by time, meaning each OHLC row correlates to one timestamp. The frequency between timestamps will depend on the resolution of data. Rows are also indexed by symbols if multiple symbols were passed into the history call.
Example - Accessing daily close data and calculating daily returns column and (calculating volatility column?)
