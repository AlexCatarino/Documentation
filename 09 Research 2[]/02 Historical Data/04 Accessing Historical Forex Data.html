<h4>Making history calls</h4>
<p>
The history call requires you to pass in the symbols you wish to retrieve data for, and the period and resolution of the data. 
There are three different ways to make a history call:
Time Period + Resolution
Bar Period + Resolution
Start Time + End Time + Resolution
</p>

<h4>Accessing and manipulating data</h4>
<p>
The dataframe returned will have a column for each data type available. Similar to equities, the dataframe will have a column for Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume data, but there will also be columns for Ask OHLC and Bid OHLC data. The rows are first indexed by time, meaning each  row correlates to one timestamp. Rows are also indexed by symbols if multiple symbols were passed into the history call.
