<p>
The data that is accessible in backtesting is purposefully limited, so that you are prevented from looking into the future during the backtest simulation. However, in Research you can directly access all of the available data simultaneously. 
</p>

<h4>API calls for accessing data</h4>
<p>
Similar to backtesting, where we subscribe to data for a security by using AddEquity/AddForexâ€¦ In research, we must also subscribe to securities using qb.AddEquity/..
Again similar to backtesting, we can make a history call using qb.History
</p>

<h4>Pandas</h4>
<p>
The data from the history call is returned in a pandas dataframe. Pandas is a python data manipulation and analysis framework. Pandas dataframes is a 2 dimensional labeled data structure, much like a spreadsheet or SQL table. A label on a row is called an Index and labels on columns are simply called columns. (Image).
