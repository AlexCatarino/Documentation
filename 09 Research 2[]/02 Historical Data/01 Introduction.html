The data that is accessible in backtesting is purposefully limited, so that you are prevented from looking into the future during the backtest simulation. However, in Research you can directly access all of the available data immediately. This includes Equities, Options, Forex, and Futures data going back as far as 1998. Similar to backtesting, the data is accessed by making history calls.

<p>
The data from the history call is returned in a pandas dataframe. Pandas is a python data manipulation and analysis framework. Pandas dataframes is a 2 dimensional labeled data structure, much like a spreadsheet or SQL table. A label on a row is called an Index and labels on columns are simply called columns. (Image).
