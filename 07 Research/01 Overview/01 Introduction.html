<h4>What is a Research Notebook?</h4>
<p>	
Jupyter notebooks were created with the intention to support interactive data science and scientific computing across various programming languages. QuantConnect carries on that philosophy by providing an environment for you to perform exploratory research and brainstorm new ideas for algorithms.  A jupyter notebook installed in QuantConnect allows you to directly explore the massive amounts of data that are available in QuantConnect and analyze it with python or C# CLI commands. We call this exploratory notebook environment the Research environment.

<h4>Why is there a Research Environment?</h4>
<p>
The backtesting environment is an event-based simulation of the market.

<h4> Accessing the Research Environment </h4>
 
<p>
A research notebook is created for every new project started in QuantConnect. However, you can create new notebooks by clicking Add New Notebook. You can access the default research notebook through the project file bar on the upper left-hand corner. Accessing the research notebook will spawn a new server which hosts the jupyter notebook you can analyze data on.
