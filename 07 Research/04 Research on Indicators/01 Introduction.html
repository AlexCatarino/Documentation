Indicators allow us to analyze market data in an abstract form rather than in its raw form. For example, indicators like the RSI tell us, based on price and volume data, if the market is overbought or oversold. Because indicators can extract overall market trends from price data, sometimes, we may want to look for correlations between indicators and the market, instead of between raw price data and the market. You can learn more about indicators in the <a href="https://www.quantconnect.com/docs/algorithm-reference/indicators">Indicators</a> documentation.
