  When the above processes and track record are insufficient, we offer ways to encrypt your code while working on the QuantConnect platform. Our encryption feature uses a locally hosted key to encrypt code at rest in our database with AES256 encryption. In case of a compromised database or rouge agent, your code would not be readable. For more information on this feature, see <a href="/docs/v2/cloud-platform/projects/encryption">Project Encryption</a>.
