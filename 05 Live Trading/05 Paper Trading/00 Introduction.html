    QuantConnect supports paper trading your strategies. This is running live, real-time, data through your algorithm but executing through a fake brokerage with fictional starting capital.
</p>
<p>
    All projects are automatically deployed with $100,000 starting capital, and the project capital is preserved between deployments of the same project.
    To reset your starting capital select the "Clone Project" button from the project menu and deploy it to live. Currently there is no way to reset or configure the starting capital for the project.

    Paper trading is included with a QuantConnect subscription, and for free on relevant assets with partner brokerages (OANDA, FXCM).
