    Paper trading is possible using your brokerage (IB, OANDA, FXCM) or the QuantConnect "Paper Brokerage Model". The QuantConnect Paper Model allows you to simulate immediate brokerage fills without first signing up to a brokerage account. Interactive Brokers supports paper trading by entering paper trading credentials, while other brokerages require selecting different API endpoints on deploying your algorithm.

<p>
    Whether our paper model or a real brokerage, you can source <b>data</b> for your algorithm from QuantConnect or your brokerage directly. Currently, only Interactive Brokers Brokerage data feed is supported. The other brokerage data sources are practically identical to QuantConnect so we have not built-in ways to use them directly.
