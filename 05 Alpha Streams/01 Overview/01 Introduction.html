Alpha Streams is a global marketplace where Quants and Funds meet. Quants offer their alpha (algorithms) for licensing, and Funds can quickly locate crowd-sourced strategies that fit their target criteria. QuantConnect acts as an independent third party to verify the strategy performance, and run it out of sample in our production environment on live market data.
