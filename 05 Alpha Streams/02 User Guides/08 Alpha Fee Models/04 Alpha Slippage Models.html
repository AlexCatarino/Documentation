Alpha Streams assumes a 1 basis point (0.01%) slippage on US Equity trades. All other asset classes are assumed to be filled at the asking price. The full implementation of the slippage model is available on <a href="https://github.com/quantconnect/Lean/blob/master/Common/Orders/Slippage/AlphaStreamsSlippageModel.cs" target="_BLANK">Github</a>.
