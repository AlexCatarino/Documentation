Running an algorithm on Quantconnect either in backtesting or in live trading requires computational resources. QuantConnect has a reservoir of compute nodes of varying degrees of power available for you to use. Every organization comes with a free B-MICRO backtesting node and R-MICRO research node. However, you can also add additional nodes, allowing your members to run faster backtests and more concurrent live algorithms.
