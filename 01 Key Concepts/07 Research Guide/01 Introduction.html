QuantConnect aims to teach and inspire the community to create high performing algorithmic trading strategies. We measure our success by the profits created by the community through their live trading. As such, we try to build the best quantitative research techniques possible into the product to encourage a robust research process.

We launched the Research Guide in 2019 to gently make you aware of common quantitative research pitfalls. It displays a power gauge for the number of backtests performed, the number of parameters used, and the time invested in the strategy. These measures can give a ballpark estimate of the <em>overfitting risk</em> of the project. Generally, as a strategy becomes more overfit on historical data, it is less likely to perform well in live trading.
