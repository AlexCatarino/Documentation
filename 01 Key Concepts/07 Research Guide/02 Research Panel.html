Backtests include a panel titled "Research Guide" which describes a few key properties recorded from your research in the current project. These properties were selected based on the current recommended best practices of the quantitative research community.

<h4>Restricting Backtests</h4>

<p>
According to current research, the number of backtests performed on an idea should be limited to prevent overfitting. In theory, each backtest performed on an idea moves it one step closer to being overfitted as you are testing and selecting for strategies written into your code instead of being based on a central thesis. For more information see the paper "<a target="_BLANK" href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2326253">Probability of Backtest Overfitting</a>".
</p>
<p>
QuantConnect does not restrict the number of backtests performed on a project, but we have implemented the counter as a guide for your reference. Your individual coding skill will play a factor in what exact number of backtests is appropriate.

<h4>Reducing Strategy Parameters</h4>

<p>
With just a handful of parameters it is possible to create an algorithm which perfectly models historical markets. Current <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.12320" target>research</a> suggests keeping your total parameter count to a minimum of important to minimize the risk of overfitting.

<h4>Research Time Invested</h4>
<div class="guide-icon"><div style="background-image: url(https://cdn.quantconnect.com/terminal/i/backtest_tab_icons/clock_rev1.svg);" class="icon"></div></div>
<p>
As you spend more and more time on one algorithm you are more likely to be overfitting the strategy to the data. It is very common to become attached to an idea, and spend weeks or months making it work in a backtest. The time invested counter aims to give you a sense of your risk for overfitting based on time investment.
