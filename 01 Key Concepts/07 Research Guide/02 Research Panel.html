Backtests include a panel titled "Research Guide" which describes a few key properties recorded from your research in the current project. These properties were selected based on the current recommended best practices of the quantitative research community.
</p>

<h4>Restricting Backtests</h4>
<p>
According to current research, the number of backtests performed on an idea should be limited to prevent overfitting. In theory, each backtest performed on an idea moves it one step closer to being overfitted as you are testing and selecting for strategies written into your code instead of being based on a central thesis. For more information see the paper "<a target="_BLANK" href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2326253">Probability of Backtest Overfitting</a>".
</p>
<p>
QuantConnect does not restrict the number of backtests performed on a project, but we have implemented the counter as a guide for your reference. The individual skill of the coder will play a factor in what exact number of backtests is appropriate.
