QuantConnect recommends developing an algorithmic trading strategy based on a central hypothesis. 
An algorithm hypothesis should be developed at the start of your research, and the remaining time spent exploring how to disprove your theory. If you find yourself deviating from your core theory, or introducing code which isn't based around that hypothesis, you should stop and go back to thesis development.

Hypothesis development is somewhat of an art, and requires creativity and great observation skills, yet is the most powerful skill a quant can learn. We recommend an algorithm hypothesis follows the pattern of  <em>cause and effect</em>.
