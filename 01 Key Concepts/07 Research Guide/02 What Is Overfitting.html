<p>
    Overfitting happens when the parameters of an algorithm are fine-tuned to fit the detail and noise of backtest data to the extent that it negatively impacts the performance of the algorithm on new data.
    This means that the noise or random fluctuations in the data are picked up by the algorithm and the trading parameters are structured to fit accordingly. The problem is that the parameters do not necessarily apply 
    to new data and negatively impact the algorithm's ability to generalize.

    Overfitting can manifest in a number of ways:

An aglorithm that is dynamic and generalizeable to new data will prove more valuable to funds and individual investors. It is more likely to survive across different market conditions and be applicable to new asset classes and markets.
