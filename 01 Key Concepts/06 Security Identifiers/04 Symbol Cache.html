<p>
  To make using the API easier QuantConnect has built technology called the <i>Symbol Cache</i> which accepts strings and tries to determine which Symbol you mean.
  Because of this many methods can simply accept a string "IBM" instead of a complete symbol, though we recommend you don't rely on this 
  technology as it can introduce subtle errors if using universes.

<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="python">self.AddEquity("IBM")   # Add by IBM string ticker, save reference to Symbol Cache.
self.MarketOrder("IBM") # Determine refering to IBM Equity from Symbol Cache.
self.MarketOrder("AAPL") # Determine refering to AAPL Equity by making a best guess.

self.ibm = self.AddEquity("IBM").Symbol   # Add by IBM string ticker, save Symbol.
self.MarketOrder(ibm)                     # Use IBM Symbol</pre>
