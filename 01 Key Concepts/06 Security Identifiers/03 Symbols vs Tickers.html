<p>
<i>Tickers</i> are a string shortcode representation for an asset. Some examples of well-known ones include "AAPL" for Apple Corporation or "IBM" for International Business Machines Corporation. These <i>tickers</i> often change when the company rebrands, or if they merge with another security.
</p>
<p>
The <i>ticker</i> for an asset is not the same as the <b>Symbol</b>. Symbol objects are permanent and track the underlying <i>entity</i>. When a company rebrands or changes its name, the QuantConnect Symbol object remains constant, giving algorithms a way to reliably track assets over time. 
</p>
<p>
Tickers are also often reused by different brokerages. For example Coinbase, a leading US Crypto Brokerage lists "BTCUSD" ticker for trading. Its competitor Bitfinex also lists "BTCUSD", and both are tradable in QuantConnect. Symbols allow us to uniquely identify which market-maker you are referencing.
