The downside of this style of identification is that it requires clients to have knowledge of the initial listing ticker string. In this example, it is GOOCV which eventually was renamed/mapped into the GOOG class C-shares. QuantConnect is working to also provide the ISIN/FIGI on all insights generated, but for now, will work with institutions engineering teams to give them the necessary information to interpret symbol objects.
