The downside of Symbols is that it requires knowledge of the initial listing ticker string. In the example above, the initial ticker GOOCV is eventually renamed/mapped into the GOOG class C-shares. QuantConnect is working to also support other identification methods (CUSIP / ISIN / Open-FIGI), but for now, Symbols allow unique identification and free distribution of the LEAN project without references to external data.
