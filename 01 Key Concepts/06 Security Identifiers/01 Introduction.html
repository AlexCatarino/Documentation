<p>
$[Symbols, T:QuantConnect.Symbol] are a way to uniquely identify an asset. They are an object which contains all the information required to identify a security, without the need for external references, or proprietary database look-ups. They were implemented in the LEAN open-source project as a way to concisely transmit the finger-print for tradable assets so no further database look-ups are required.

<p>All QuantConnect and LEAN Algorithm API methods use Symbols to identify the asset for trading.</p>
