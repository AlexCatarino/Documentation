When a Symbol is serialized to a string it will look something like this: <code>SPY R735QTJ8XC9X</code>. This two-part string is a base64 encoded set of data. Encoding all of the properties into a short format allows dense communication without requiring a third party list or look-up. 
</p>

<p>Most of the time you will not need to work with these encoded strings. However, QuantConnect provides a method for deserializing Symbol objects into easily consumable objects for use by the API. You can use this method as demonstrated below:
</p>
<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="all"># Python 
google = self.Symbol("GOOCV VP83T1ZUHROL")
print(google.ID.Market)                             # USA
print(google.SecurityType)                          # Equity
print(google.Value)                                # GOOCV

# CSharp
var google = Symbol("GOOCV VP83T1ZUHROL");
google.ID.Market                    # Market.USA
google.SecurityType                 # SecurityType.Equity
google.Value                       # GOOCV
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The <code>Market</code> property is used to distinguish between tickers with the same string value representing different underlying assets. A prime example of this is the various market makers who have different prices for EURUSD. QuantConnect stores this data separately, and as they have different fill prices we treat the execution venues as different <i>markets</i>.
