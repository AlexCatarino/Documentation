	QuantConnect makes backtesting available for free and charges a small monthly fee to cover live algorithm trading. 
	This offsets our costs and aligns our interests with yours - our client. We also work with brokerages to make your live trading free.

	In 2018 driven by user demand we launched <a href="/alpha">Alpha Streams</a> to systematically match good algorithms with hedge funds. Alpha Streams is a world first marketplace of hedge funds who compete to license your strategy. When a fund licenses your algorithm we pass along 100% of your revenues to you and invoice the fund directly a revenue share equivalent to 30%.
