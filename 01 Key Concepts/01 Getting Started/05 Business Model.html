QuantConnect makes backtesting available for free and charges a small monthly fee to cover live algorithm trading. 
	This offsets our costs and aligns our interests with yours - our client. We also work with brokerages to make your 
	live trading free.

	In 2018 driven by user demand we launched <a href="/alpha">Alpha Streams</a> to systematically match good algorithms with hedge funds. Alpha Streams is a world first marketplace of hedge funds who complete to license your strategy. When a fund licenses your algorithm we charge 30% of the revenues, passing along 70% to you.
