	Write code in project files and then press the <i class="fa fa-cogs"></i> Build button to compile your algorithm. Build errors will be displayed in the console and highlighted with red-lines.

	You can add, rename and delete files in your project in the Projects tab. You can create a virtual folder for your project by placing a slash ("/") into the name of your file.
	Algorithms require only initialization and data event handlers.
