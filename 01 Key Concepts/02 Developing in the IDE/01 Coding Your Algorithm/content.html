	Write code in project files and then press the <i class="fa fa-cogs"></i> Build button to compile your algorithm. Build errors will be displayed in the console and highlighted with red-lines.

<p>
	You can add, rename and delete files in your project in the Projects tab. You can create a virtual folder for your project by placing a slash ("/") into the name of your file.
	The bare minimum to run an algorithm is your initialization and data event methods.
