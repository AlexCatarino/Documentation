	Once you've got an algorithm compiling, you can click the <i class="fa fa-play"></i> Play button to launch a backtest. Results are shown in the Result drop-down menu. Backtesting in parallel is limited to fair usage for each user and may be reduced when it affects others in the community.

Running backtests are summarized on the terminal homepage and can be canceled from there to make room for other backtests.
