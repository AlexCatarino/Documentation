The total reconciliation project is a way to understand, <a href = "https://www.quantconnect.com/forum/discussion/7454/live-reconciliation-overlayed-out-of-sample-backtests/p1">display</a>, and <a href = "https://www.quantconnect.com/forum/discussion/7606/a-new-reconciliation-metric/p1">quantify</a> the difference between an algorithm's live performance and its out-of-sample (OOS) performance (a backtest run over the live deployment period).
</p>
<p>
Seeing and understanding the differences between live performance and OOS performance is essential in algorithm development. It gives traders a way to determine if their initial backtests were making unrealistic assumptions, exploiting data differences, or merely exhibiting behavior that is impractical or impossible in live trading.
</p>
<p>A perfectly reconciled algorithm has an exact overlap between its live equity and OOS backtest curves. Any deviation means that, somehow, the performance of the algorithm has differed between the two samples. Several factors can contribute to this, and our goal is to provide our users with the best tools possible to reconcile their algorithm performance. Still, it often stems from algorithm design itself.</p>
