 Reconciliation is scored using two metrics: returns correlation and dynamic time warping (DTW) distance.
</p>
<h5> DTW Distance</h5>
<p>
DTW distance is a measurement of time-series dissimilarity. More precisely, dynamic time warping is an algorithm that measures the shortest path between the points of two time-series. It uses Euclidean distance as a measurement of point-to-point distance, and returns an overall measurement of the distance on the scale of the initial time-series values. We apply DTW to the returns curve of
