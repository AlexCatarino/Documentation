 Reconciliation is scored using two metrics: returns correlation and dynamic time warping (DTW) distance.

<h4> DTW Distance</h4>
<p>
DTW distance is a measurement of time-series dissimilarity. More precisely, dynamic time warping is an algorithm that measures the shortest path between the points of two time-series. It uses Euclidean distance as a measurement of point-to-point distance, and returns an overall measurement of the distance on the scale of the initial time-series values. We apply DTW to the returns curve of

Each measurement provides insight into distinct elements of time-series similarity or dissimilarity, but neither measurement gives us the whole picture. Returns correlation tells us whether or not the live and OOS returns move together, but it doesn't account for the possible differences in the magnitude of the returns. DTW distance measures the difference in magnitude of returns but provides no insight into whether or not the returns move in the same direction. It is possible for there to be two cases of equity curve similarity where both have the same DTW distance, but one has perfectly negatively correlated returns, and the other has a perfectly positive correlation. Similarly, it is possible for two pairs of equity curves to each have perfect correlation but substantially different DTW distance. Having both measurements provides us with a more comprehensive understanding of the actual similarity between live and OOS performance. We outline several interesting cases and go into more depth on the topic of reconciliation in the research notebook attached below.
