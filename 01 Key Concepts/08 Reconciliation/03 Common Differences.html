<p>Some of reasons listed below pertain more to Alpha Streams than individual trading, but all are worth keeping in mind!</p>
<h4>Insight Weights</h4>
<p>
An essential part of an Alpha Streams submission is its ability to be reproduced. Funds want to be able to duplicate backtest and live results using the Insights and orders generated by your Alphas. Insight weights are crucial to this, as several framework models can be used by funds to consumer Insights and use them to generate trades. When using conventional API, such as SetHoldings, it is vital to make sure these weights match those of the Insights. Funds cannot see your code, and so the Insights need to contain as much information as possible for them to execute the same trades.
</p>
<h4>Tags</h4>
<p>
Tags serve an essential role in Alpha Streams. Since funds don’t see your code, tagging them is crucial to conveying important information. Much like Insight weights, well-tagged submissions can tell funds a lot about how to go about replicating your Alpha’s performance -- weighting schemes, risk management, execution models, style of Alpha, etc.
</p>

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>
Like tags, descriptions are a big part of conveying information about your Alpha. Funds want to know as much as possible about the theory or method behind the signals generated by the Alpha. If your Alpha relies on academic research, it is a good idea to include a basic outline of that research. If it uses complex statistical analysis, you should give a description that outlines the basic framework of that analysis without giving away anything proprietary. A thorough description can provide a lot of information about your Alpha that can’t be conveyed by Insights and order-flow information alone.
</p>
<h4>Custom models</h4>
<p>
We love seeing authors engaging with the Framework models -- it is great to see some unique ideas about portfolio construction, execution, and risk management implemented using the Framework. These models, however, won’t be able to be fully reproduced by the funds. Any significant changes or customization to our standard library of Framework models should be documented, to a reasonable extent, in the Alpha description. For example, if you modify one of the portfolio construction models to add in variables such as volatility, leverage, etc., it is good practice to mention that these constraints in your description about your custom model.

<h4>Custom Orders</h4>
 <p>(is this needed since we’ll be providing order-flow? If so, it would fall into sort of the same category of custom models)</p>


<h4>Data resolution incompatibility</h4>
<p>
Using the correct data resolution for your Alpha submission is essential to reproducibility. Specifically, Alphas that have events scheduled intra-day using Scheduled Events or other means need to use Minute resolution data. Using the wrong data resolution can lead to stale prices, which can corrupt your signals and the results they produce. Daily data is fine to use when position rebalancing takes place overnight, but it is best to use Minute resolution data when possible (???? This seems like a pretty bad explanation)
