<h4>Data Resolution Incompatibility</h4>
<p>
Using the correct data resolution is essential. Specifically, algorithms that have events scheduled intra-day, using the Scheduled Events API or by other means, need to use minute resolution data. Using the wrong data resolution can lead to stale prices and order fills, corrupting the signals and the results they produce.

<h4>Universe Selection</h4>
<p>
If an algorithm uses a version of the Coarse/Fine Fundamental Universe Selection Model rather than manually adding securities, this can cause differences in the securities selected. In backtesting, universe selection happens at midnight (00:00 EST). In live, it occurs when market data is processed, which can occur anytime between 05:00 to 08:00 EST. Backtesting data is cleaned and consolidated, but live data is less deterministic, leading to potential differences in the securities selected. This can be especially problematic if events are scheduled to happen in the time window when universe selection happens in live trading.
