<h4>Data Resolution Incompatibility</h4>
<p>
Using the correct data resolution is essential. Specifically, algorithms that have events scheduled intra-day, using the Scheduled Events API or by other means, need to use minute resolution data. Using the wrong data resolution can lead to stale prices and order fills, corrupting the signals and the results they produce.
