<h4>Data Resolution Incompatibility</h4>
<p>
Using the correct data resolution is essential. Specifically, algorithms that have events scheduled intra-day, using the Scheduled Events API or by other means, need to use minute resolution data. Using the wrong data resolution can lead to stale prices and order fills, corrupting the signals and the results they produce.
</p>

<h4>Universe Selection</h4>
<p>
If an algorithm uses a version of the Coarse/Fine Fundamental Universe Selection Model rather than manually adding securities, this can cause differences in the securities selected. In backtesting, universe selection happens at midnight (00:00 EST). In live trading, it occurs when market data is processed, which can occur anytime between 05:00 to 08:00 EST. Backtesting data is cleaned and consolidated, but live data is less deterministic, leading to potential differences in the securities selected. This can be especially problematic if events are scheduled to happen in the time window when universe selection happens in live trading.
</p>

<h4>External Data Sources</h4>
<p>
Each day, a backtest is run to generate the OOS curve. If an algorithm relies on an external data source, exceptional care must be used when coding. External data can be changed, stop being available, or received at a different time in live trading than in backtesting. The OOS backtest might not be able to fetch the same data at the same time or frequency that it is received in live trading. This can corrupt signals, lead to stale data and order placement, or otherwise adversely affect performance in some other manner, leading to differences in OOS and live trading curves.
</p>

<h4>Existing Portfolio Securities</h4>
<p>
When an algorithm is deployed to a live brokerage account, it will accommodate any current positions that are open, even those unrelated to the algorithm itself. In backtesting, an empty portfolio is assumed. These pre-existing live positions aren't currently reflected in our reconciliation technology, and if they contribute to the live performance of your total portfolio, differences will inevitably exist between the OOS and live curves.
</p>

<h4>Using the Time Property</h4>
<p>
In backtesting, time is a discrete process. Time intervals are rounded and time-steps are done in precise intervals. When trading live, however, time is a constant stream. Code that checks for precise times will execute more precisely in backtesting than in live trading.
<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="python">
if self.Time.hour == 9 and self.Time.minute == 31:
    self.SetHoldings("SPY", 0.5)
</pre>
<pre class="csharp">
if (Time.Hour == 9 & Time.Minute== 31)
{
    SetHoldings("SPY", 0.5);
}
</pre>
</div>
<p>
In the case above, live trading time will likely be milliseconds behind or ahead of precisely 09:31, leading to differences in OOS and live performance.
