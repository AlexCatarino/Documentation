<p>
    In QuantConnect, the <code>self.Log()</code> method is very close to the <code>log.info()</code> method in Quantopian.
    Logging is rate-limited in QuantConnect as well, and users on the free tier get up to 10KB worth of logs per day. To
    the logs that were generated, head into the tab for the backtest, scroll down past all of the charts, and you will see
    a "Logs" tab that contains all the logs generated by the backtest. Furthermore, a .txt file of the logs can be downloaded
    if the user opens up the Console (found near the bottom of the screen while in the Lab) and click the .txt link generated.
