<p>
    In QuantConnect, plotting is usually done with the <code>self.Plot("chart name", "series name", value)</code>, while plotting
    in Quantopian is simply <code>record(series1_name=value, series2_name=value, etc.)</code>. While creating multiple plotting
    series through one line is possible in Quantopian, in QuantConnect, a separate call is needed for each series. Furthermore,
    all series with the same <code>chart name</code> string will be on the same chart, and new charts can be created by
    calling <code>self.Plot</code> with a different <code>chart name</code>. For example:</p>
<div class="section-example-container">
    <pre class="python">    class Algorithm(QCAlgorithm):
        ...
        def OnData(self, data):
            self.Plot('Chart1', 'Series1', 1)
            self.Plot('Chart1', 'Series2', 2)
            self.Plot('Chart2', 'c2 Series1', 3)
    </pre>
</div>
<p>
    Will create two charts, one named "Chart1" with two series of data, and another named "Chart2" with one series of data.
    However, for users who wish to add the chart under the equity curve, simply use <code>self.Plot("series name", value)</code>. More information on plotting can be found in the <a href="https://www.quantconnect.com/docs/algorithm-reference/charting#Charting-Introduction">Charting</a> section of our Documentation.
