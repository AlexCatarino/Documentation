  Quantopian's <code>Portfolio</code> class provides read-only access to the current portfolio state. The state 
  includes starting cash, current cash, portfolio value, and positions. The associated <code>Position</code> class 
  tracks the amount held of an asset, the cost basis, and the last sale price. All of this information is 
  attainable on QuantConnect by using our <code>Portfolio</code> object.
</p>

<p>Our <code>Portfolio</code> has the following members:</p>
<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="python">
self.Portfolio.Invested                # Hold at least one stock
              .Cash                    # Sum of all currencies in account (only settled cash)
              .UnsettledCash           # Sum of all currencies in account (only unsettled cash)
              .TotalFees               # Fees incurred since backtest start
              .TotalHoldingsValue      # Absolute sum portfolio items
              .MarginRemaining         # Remaining margin on the account
              .TotalMarginUsed         # Sum of margin used across all securities
              .TotalPortfolioValue     # Portfolio equity
              .TotalProfit             # Sum of all gross profit
              .TotalUnrealizedProfit   # Holdings profit/loss

  Since the <code>Portfolio</code> is a <code>Dictionary&lt;Symbol, SecurityHolding&gt;</code>, we can get information 
  on current positions by indexing the <code>Portfolio</code> object with a <code>Symbol</code> or ticker. The 
  <code>SecurityHolding</code> object that is returned contains information related to a single security in the 
  portfolio. For instance, we have
</p>
<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="python">
self.Portfolio['SPY'].Quantity                 # Number of shares held
                     .AveragePrice             # Average price of shares held (aka cost basis)
                     .Price                    # Current market price of the security
                     .Leverage                 # Leverage of the underlying security
                     .TotalFees                # Total fees for this company since the algorithm started
                     .TotalSaleVolume          # Trade volume for this security since algorithm start
                     .UnrealizedProfit         # Unrealized profit of this security
                     .UnrealizedProfitPercent  # Unrealized profit as a percenage of holdings cost
