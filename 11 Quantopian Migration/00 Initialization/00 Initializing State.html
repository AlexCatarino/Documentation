<p>
    On QuantConnect, algorithm initialization behavior is equivalent to Quantopian's <code>initialize</code> method.
    <code>Initialize</code> is the method equivalent, and it is only ran once at the start of the algorithm. 
    It is responsible for initially adding data to the algorithm, adding a universe, setting the brokerage, setting the algorithm's
    start and end date, etc.
</p>

<p>
    On QuantConnect, the <code>self</code> parameter is the equivalent of the <code>context</code> parameter in Quantopian algorithms.
    You can use <code>self</code> to access algorithm resources, such as the Portfolio, Orders, Order Tickets, Securities, place orders in your algorithm, and much more.
</p>

<p>
    The two methods are equivalent, with the exception of the <code>context</code> parameter being named <code>self</code>.
    <code>def initialize(context): ...</code> is the same as <code>def Initialize(self): ...</code>
</p>
<p>
    The algorithm structure differs too. On QuantConnect, we create a class that derives from <code>QCAlgorithm</code> and define
    our overrides/algorithm functionality there. An example of an algorithm with initialization is provided.
