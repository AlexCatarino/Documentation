    QuantConnect supports applying slippage and commissions per individual security.
</p>
<p>
    To add a slippage model to a security, we must set the <code>SlippageModel</code> property 
    of the <code>Security</code> object to our model. A <code>Security</code> is returned
    when data is added to the algorithm.

    An example is provided below.
</p>
<div class="section-example-container">
    <pre class="python">class MyAlgorithm(QCAlgorithm)
    def Initialize(self):
        spy = self.AddEquity("SPY", Resolution.Minute)
        # `ConstantSlippageModel` is the same as `FixedSlippage` on Quantopian
        spy.SlippageModel = ConstantSlippageModel(0.01)</pre>
</div>

<h4>Commissions</h3>
<p>
    To add a fee model (otherwise known as Commissions on Quantopian) to a security,
    we must set the <code>FeeModel</code> property of the <code>Security</code> object
    to our model.

    An example is provided below.
</p>
<div class="section-example-container">
    <pre class="python">class MyAlgorithm(QCAlgorithm):
    def Initialize(self):
       aapl = self.AddEquity("AAPL", Resolution.Minute)
       spy = self.AddEquity("SPY", Resolution.Minute)
       # Sets the fee model to the IB fee model, which simulates
       # the fees we would encounter in live trading.
       spy.FeeModel = InteractiveBrokersFeeModel()

       # Sets the fee model to a constant fee model
       aapl.FeeModel = ConstantFeeModel(0.01, "USD")</pre>
</div>
