<p>A challenge of working with datasets is that it can be difficult to find a reliable, high-quality, and inexpensive data feed to use in live algorithms. If a data feed has survivorship bias, insufficient history, or hasnâ€™t been cleaned and processed properly, the data feed can cause poor trading performance. We thoroughly vet the datasets we add to the Dataset Market to ensure they are free of survivorship bias and have a reliable live feed. All of the available datasets have already been cleaned and processed, so you can just focus on the strategy research and development.</p>
