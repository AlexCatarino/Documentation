<p>Challenge of working with datasets is that it can be difficult to find a reliable data feed to use in live trading algorithms, live data feeds can be expensive, and data feeds can be low quality. If a data feed has survivorship bias, insufficient history, or hasnâ€™t been cleaned and processed properly, the data feed can cause poor trading performance. We thoroughly vet the datasets we add to the Dataset Market to ensure they are free of survivorship bias and have a reliable live data feed. All of the available datasets have already be cleaned and processed to save you time.</p>
