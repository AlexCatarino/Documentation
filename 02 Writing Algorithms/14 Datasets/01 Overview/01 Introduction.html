<p>All datasets that are not classified as market or fundamental datasets are alternative datasets. Alternative data research began gaining popularity in 2007 after the financial crisis and its usage has continued to grow over the years. As usage has grown, so has the number of unique alternative datasets that are available for investors. The benefit of alternative datasets is that itâ€™s easier to find alpha in these datasets because they receive less attention from investment researchers and these datasets contain information not found in market and fundamental datasets. Most traders research with market and fundamental datasets, so it's difficult to find alpha in them.</p>
