<p>The alternative data field is still in the early phases of development. Alternative datasets are an ever-expanding data source, so it’s expected to continue to grow into the future. In today’s digital world, more data is created each year than the preceding year. To take advantage of the trend, we have implemented a new onboarding process to integrate many new alternative data sources into the QuantConnect platform. With the Data Market, a new alternative dataset can be imported into your trading algorithm with only a single line of code. The Data Market gives everyone the ability to access high-quality alternative datasets that were previously only accessible to major hedge funds.</p>
