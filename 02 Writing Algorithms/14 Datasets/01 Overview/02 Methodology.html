<p>The journey of raw data from its source to its integration with a trading platform can be complex. Alternative data is generally created through individuals, business processes, and sensors. Individuals create content on social media platforms, write reviews on e-commerce sites, and visit corporate Wikipedia pages. Businesses process transactions, file SEC reports, and issue company announcements. Sensors collect location data, gather satellite images, and monitor customer behavior.
