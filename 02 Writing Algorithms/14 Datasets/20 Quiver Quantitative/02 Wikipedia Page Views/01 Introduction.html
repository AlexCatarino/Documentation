<p>Wikipedia Page Views by Quiver Quantitative tracks Wikipedia page views for US Equities. The data covers 1,300 US Equities, starting in October 2016, and is delivered on a daily frequency if there is data on that day. The dataset is created by scraping the companyâ€™s Wikipedia page.</p>

<p>This dataset depends on the <a href="https://www.quantconnect.com/datasets/quantconnect-us-equity-security-master">US Equity Security Master</a> dataset because the US Equity Security Master dataset contains information on splits, dividends, and symbol changes.</p>
