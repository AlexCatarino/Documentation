<p>The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) is a real-time index that represents the market's expectations for the relative strength of near-term price changes of the S&amp;P 500 index (SPX). Because it's derived from the prices of SPX index Options with near-term expiration dates, it generates a 30-day forward projection of volatility. Volatility, or how fast prices change, is often seen as a way to gauge market sentiment, and in particular, the degree of fear among market participants.</p>

<h4>SPX - S&amp;P 500 Index</h4>
<p>The S&amp;P 500 Index, or the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index, is a market-capitalization-weighted index of the 500 largest publicly-traded companies in the U.S. It is not an exact list of the top 500 U.S. companies by market capitalization because there are other criteria included in the index. The index is widely regarded as the best gauge of large-cap U.S. Equities. </p>
