<p>The Brain Sentiment Indicator dataset by Brain tracks the public sentiment around US Equities. The data covers 4,500 US Equities, starts in August 2016, and is delivered on a daily frequency. This dataset is created by analyzing financial news using Natural Language Processing techniques while taking into account the similarity and repetition of news on the same topic. The sentiment score assigned to each stock ranges from -1 (most negative) to +1 (most positive). The sentiment score corresponds to the average sentiment for each piece of news. The score is updated daily and is available on two time scales: 7 days and 30 days.
