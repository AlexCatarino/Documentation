<p>Tactical by ExtractAlpha is a stock selection model scoring algorithm designed to capture the technical dynamics of single US Equities over one to ten trading day horizons. It can assist a longer-horizon investor in timing their entry or exit points, or be used in combination with existing systematic or qualitative strategies with similar holding periods.
<br /><br />
The data covers a dynamic universe of around 4,700 US Equities on a daily average, starting in January 2000, and is delivered on a daily frequency. The Tactical dataset expands upon simple reversal factors in several key factors, to identify stocks that are likely to trend or reverse, and by incorporating liquidity and seasonality effects.
