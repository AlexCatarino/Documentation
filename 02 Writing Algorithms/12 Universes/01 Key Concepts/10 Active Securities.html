It's especially relevant to talk about Active Securities here.<br>
- It's a Dictionary of Security objects keyed by Symbol as the Securities object<br>
- It looks for the Securities in the UniverseManager<br>

<p>You can use the algorithm <code class="python">self.ActiveSecurities</code><code class="csharp">ActiveSecurities</code> property to get the list of assets currently in a universe. When you deselect an asset you currently own or have open orders, it will continue receiving data until you no longer have a position or open orders for the security. This is to ensure the portfolio models are accurate. Additionally, even once removed from the universe the security object in the Securties collection is maintained for record keeping purposes (e.g. total fees accrued, volume traded).</p>
