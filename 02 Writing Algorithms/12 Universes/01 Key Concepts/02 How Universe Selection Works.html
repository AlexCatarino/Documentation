<p>Universe Selection sends a large data set into a filter function. After passing through your filters, the algorithm needs you to return an array of <code>Symbol</code> objects. LEAN automatically subscribes to these new symbols and adds them to your algorithm. Your algorithm can do almost anything inside your filter functions, but the goal should be to narrow down the set of securities to a few which are most applicable for your algorithm.</p>

<p>You can use the algorithm <code class="python">self.ActiveSecurities</code><code class="csharp">ActiveSecurities</code> property to get the list of assets currently in a universe. When you deselect an asset you currently own or have open orders, it will continue receiving data. This is to ensure the portfolio models are accurate. Additionally, even once removed from the universe the security object in the Securties collection is maintained for record keeping purposes (e.g. total fees accrued, volume traded).</p>

<p>By default, assets selected by universe selection are requested with minute resolution data. You can change the default selection by adjusting the <code>UniverseSettings</code> property, which we'll dive into below.</p>
