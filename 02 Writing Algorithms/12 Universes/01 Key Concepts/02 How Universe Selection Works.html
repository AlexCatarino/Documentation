<p>Universe Selection sends a large data set into a filter function. After passing through your filters, the algorithm needs you to return an array of <code>Symbol</code> objects. LEAN automatically subscribes to these new symbols and adds them to your algorithm. Your algorithm can do almost anything inside your filter functions, but the goal should be to narrow down the set of securities to the securities that are most applicable for your algorithm.</p>
