What/Why:
<br>- If you create security subscriptions in your algorithm with the AddEquity, AddCrypto, AddForex, AddIndex, or AddCfd methods, the security stays in your universe until you manually remove it. This creates a static, "user-defined" universe. In contrast, universe selection creates a dynamic universe that periodically selects new securities to add to the universe and deselect securities to remove from the universe.

<br><br>How:
<br><div>-Instead of using AddEquity, etc, use AddUniverse to perform universe</div><div>-To see examples, refer to the universe page that's dedicated to each asset class.<br></div>
