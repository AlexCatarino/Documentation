When you add an option to the algorithm it adds many individual option contract securities. These are modelled as a "universe" of option contracts. We provide the $[SetFilter,M:QuantConnect.Securities.Option.Option.SetFilter] method to help narrow the option strike and expiry dates down to a range you are interested in.

<p>## Copy from Asset Classes &gt; Equity Options &gt; Requesting Data &gt; Creating Subscriptions &gt; Technique 1</p><p>- Option contracts are added to the chain when they pass the SetFilter method criteria. In backtests, contracts are removed from the chain on the NEXT DAY when they no longer satisify the SetFilter method. In live trading, they can be removed every 15 mins.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; - As a result, your chain may have more contracts that you expect at times.
