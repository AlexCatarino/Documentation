Universe selection is the process of screening or filtering the assets you'd like to trade by some predetermined formula. This helps to avoid <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_bias" target="_BLANK">selection bias</a> in your algorithm. The following section introduces how to use the QuantConnect Universe Selection API.

QuantConnect provides two universes; Coarse Universe, and Fine Universe for the US Equities Market. The QuantConnect Universe data is refreshed every day. You can also create custom universes of data which we'll explore later in this section. <br></p>

An active security is a security that is currently selected by the universe or has holdings or open orders <br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Can use it to get the individual Universes in the algorithm https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean/blob/master/Common/Data/UniverseSelection/Universe.cs</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Universes have the following members: Securities, Market, UniverseSettings, Configuration, Members</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Document Member class https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean/blob/master/Common/Data/UniverseSelection/Universe.cs#L378<br></p>
