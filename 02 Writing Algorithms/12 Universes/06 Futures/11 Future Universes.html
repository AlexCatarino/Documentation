<p>
When you add a futures asset to your algorithm, it adds all the contracts which match your filter as a universe of futures contracts in a similar way to option. The primary difference is that futures don't have a strike price, so the universe filter is primarily focused on the future expiration date.</p>
<p>## Copy from Asset Classes &gt; Futures &gt; Requesting Data &gt; Creating Subscriptions &gt; Technique 1</p><p>- Future contracts are added to the chain when they pass the 
SetFilter method criteria. In backtests, contracts are removed from the 
chain on the NEXT DAY when they no longer satisify the SetFilter method.
 In live trading, they can be removed every 15 mins.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp; - As a 
result, your chain may have more contracts that you expect at times. See
