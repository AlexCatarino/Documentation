<p>An alternative data universe lets you select a basket of assets based on an alternative dataset that's linked to securities. If you add an alternative dataset to your algorithm and only trade securities that are included in the dataset, your universe should only consist of securities in the dataset. If you use an alternative data universe, you limit your universe to only the securities that are in the dataset, which removes unnecessary subscriptions and speeds up your algorithm. If you don't use an alternative data universe when you trade with an alternative dataset, your universe can consist of securities that aren't in the dataset.</p>
