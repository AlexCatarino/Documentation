<p>An alternative data universe lets you select a basket of assets based on an alternative dataset that's linked to securities. If you add an alternative dataset to your algorithm and only trade securities that are included in the dataset, your universe should only consist of securities in the dataset. If you use an alternative data universe, you limit your universe to only the securities that are in the dataset, which removes unnecessary subscriptions and speeds up your algorithm. If you place trades based on an alternative dataset and don't use the corresponding alternative data universe, your algorithm may subscribe to assets you never trade.</p>
