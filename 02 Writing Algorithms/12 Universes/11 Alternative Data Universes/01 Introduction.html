<p>An alternative data universe lets you select a basket of assets based on an alternative dataset that's linked to securities. If you use an alternative data universe, you limit your universe to only the securities in the dataset, which avoids unnecessary subscriptions. If you place trades based on an alternative dataset and don't use the corresponding alternative data universe, your algorithm may subscribe to assets you never trade.</p>
