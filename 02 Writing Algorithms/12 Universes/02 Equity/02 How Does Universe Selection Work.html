<p>With coarse-fine universe selection, you receive a large data set into a filter function. After passing through your filters, the algorithm needs you to return an array of <code>Symbol</code> objects. LEAN automatically subscribes to these new symbols and adds them to your algorithm.</p>

<p>Your algorithm can do almost anything inside your filter functions, but the goal should be to narrow down the 10,000 daily stocks to a few which are most applicable for your algorithm.</p>

<p>The first stage of the filter is called "Coarse Universe Selection". This is for roughly filtering down the universe by simple properties like price and volume. The <i>result</i> of this is piped into the "Fine Universe Selection" function to perform selection on <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/asset-classes/us-equity/corporate-fundamentals">fundamental data</a> like PE Ratio and Earnings.</p><p>- Securities that pass the fine filter are automatically added to your universe. You don't need to call AddEquity.</p><p>- If you want to keep the same universe, you can return <code>Universe.Unchanged</code> from both filter functions.<br></p>
