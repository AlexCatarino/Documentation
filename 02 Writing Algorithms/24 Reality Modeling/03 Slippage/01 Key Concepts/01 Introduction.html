<p>Slippage is the difference between the expected fill price and the actual fill price. Slippage models model slippage to make backtest results more realistic. Since the price can move in the direction of your trade or against the direction of your traded, slippage can be positive or negative. In volatile markets, you are likely to experience more slippage.</p>
