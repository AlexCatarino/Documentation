<div>What is a slippage model:
-Slippage models model slippage, which is the difference in price between your last reported quote and the real price the trade filled at. This difference can be positive or negative, as sometimes the price can slip in your favor. In volatile markets, you are likely to experience more slippage

Why are there slippage models:
-To accurately fill orders at realistic prices / to make the backtest results more reliable

What slippage models are supported:
-ConstantSlippageModel (for equities): A constant slippage percentage, defined when creating the model
-AlphaStreamsSlippageModel (for alpha streams): slippage model that uses a constant percentage of slip 0.01%
-VolumeShareSlippageModel (for forex): Slippage calculated by multiplying the price impact constant by the square of the ratio of the order to the total volume.

 recommend you include a slippage model in your algorithm. Slippage is 
the difference between the expected and final fill prices of a trade. </div>
