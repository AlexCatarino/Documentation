The volatility model is a property of a security. Exactly how volatility is calculated varies a lot between strategies, so we've provided an override point here. Volatility models get updated with data each time step and are expected to be updated immediately. This is primarily required for options backtesting.

	Volatility models implement the $[VolatilityModel,T:QuantConnect.Securities.VolatilityModel] interface. We default to the NullVolatilityModel which returns 0 volatility at all times. As a helper, we also provide the $[RelativeStandardDeviationVolatilityModel,T:QuantConnect.Securities.RelativeStandardDeviationVolatilityModel], which calculates the volatility based on standard deviation.
