<p>Implied volatility is the forecasted future volatility of a security. The Option price model uses the realized volatility to calculate the implied volatility. By default, it uses the formula from <a rel='nofollow' target='_blank' href='https://www.researchgate.net/publication/245065192_A_Simple_Formula_to_Compute_the_Implied_Standard_Deviation'>Brenner and Subrahmanyam (1988)</a> as the initial guess for implied volatility.</p>

\[ \frac{ \sqrt{ \frac{2 \pi} {T} } * P } { S }  \]

<p>where \(T\) is the time until Option expiration, \(P\) is the Option contract price, and \(S\) is the underlying price.</p>

<p>If the <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/reality-modeling/options-models/volatility/key-concepts'>volatility model</a> of the underlying security is <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/reality-modeling/options-models/volatility/key-concepts#07-Warm-Up-Models'>ready</a>, the price model uses its value as the initial guess for implied volatility and as an input to calculate the theoretical contract prices.</p>
