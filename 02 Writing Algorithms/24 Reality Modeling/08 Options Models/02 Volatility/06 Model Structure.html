<div>- Volatility models implement the 
$[VolatilityModel,T:QuantConnect.Securities.VolatilityModel] interface. 
We default to the NullVolatilityModel which returns 0 volatility at all 
times. As a helper, we also provide the 
$[RelativeStandardDeviationVolatilityModel,T:QuantConnect.Securities.RelativeStandardDeviationVolatilityModel],
 which calculates the volatility based on standard deviation. </div>
