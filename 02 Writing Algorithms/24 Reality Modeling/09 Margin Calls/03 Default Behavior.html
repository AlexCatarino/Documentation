<p>The brokerage model of your algorithm automatically sets the margin call model for the portfolio. The default brokerage model is the <code>DefaultBrokerageModel</code>, which sets the <code>DefaultMarginCallModel</code>. When a margin call occurs, the <code>DefaultMarginCallModel</code> sorts the generated margin call orders in ascending order by their unrealized profit and then executes each order synchronously until your portfolio is within the margin requirements.</p>
