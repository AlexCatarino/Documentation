<p>If the value of your portfolio falls below the maintenance margin, you receive a margin call. If you receive a margin call, you either need to add more capital to your brokerage account or the brokerage will liquidate some of your holdings to reduce your exposure and their risk. A margin call model monitors the margin levels of your portfolio, issues margin call warnings, and submits orders when margin calls occur.</p>
