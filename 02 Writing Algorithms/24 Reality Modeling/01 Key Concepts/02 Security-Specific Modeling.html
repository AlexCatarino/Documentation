LEAN philosophy is to make the models per security as much as possible, so there are various plugin points on the security object.
Some reality models are portfolio level models. 

<p>
	To set a security-specific model, first fetch the security object and apply your model.

Securities["IBM"].FeeModel = new ConstantFeeTransactionModel(1); </pre>
