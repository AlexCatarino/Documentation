<p>LEAN uses reality models to make backtests as realistic as possible to how the strategy would have performed in live trading. These reality models model the behavior of things like the portfolio, brokerage, fills, slippage, options, and strategy capacity. The default models assume you trade highly liquid assets. If you trade high volumes or on illiquid assets, you should create custom reality models to be more realistic.</p>
