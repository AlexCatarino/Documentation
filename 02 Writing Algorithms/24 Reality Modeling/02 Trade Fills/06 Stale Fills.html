<p>Stale fills occur when you fill an order with price data that is timestamped an hour or more into the past. The pre-built fill models can only fill market orders with stale data. To adjust the length of time that needs to pass before an order is considered stale, set the <code>StalePriceTimeSpan</code> setting.</p>
