<div>- In live trading, orders can be partially filled. <br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp; - For example, let's say you have a buy limit order on the bid for 100 shares and a seller sells 10 shares with a market order, you'll be partially filled.<br></div><div>- In backtests, the standard fill models assume orders are completely filled. To simulate partial fills in backtests, create a custom fill model.</div>
