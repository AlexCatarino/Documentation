<p>In live trading, your orders can partially fill. For example, if you have a buy limit order at the bid price for 100 shares and a seller sells 10 shares with a market order, your order is partially filled. In backtests, the standard fill models assume orders fill completely. To simulate partial fills in backtests, create a custom fill model.</p>
