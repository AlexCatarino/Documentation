<p>Stale fills occur when you fill an order with price data that is timestamped an hour or more into the past. The pre-built fill models can only fill market orders with stale data. To adjust the length of time that needs to pass before an order is considered stale, set the <code>StalePriceTimeSpan</code> setting.</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="csharp">Settings.StalePriceTimeSpan = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(10);</pre>
<pre class="python">self.Settings.StalePriceTimeSpan = timedelta(minutes=10)</pre>
</div>
