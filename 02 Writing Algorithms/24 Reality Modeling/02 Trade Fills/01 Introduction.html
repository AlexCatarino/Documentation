What is portfolio modelling:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Portfolio models control how order fills are applied to your portfolio.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Portfolios are semi-closed systems (closed except for when you're depositing/withdrawing funds or fees are incurred) where their state is updated over time<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The equity of the portfolio just transitions between assets (cash and securities)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The equity doesn't change. What changes is the value of the things we buy<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The portfolio has the holdings that are updated by the orders<br><br>Why is there portfolio modeling:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - To realistically model how a portfolio changes in response to order fills (including fees)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - To track/update the average price of security holdings with each order fill<br><br>How(?):<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Portfolio models take an OrderEvent, Security, and SecurityPortfolioManager object and update the holdings to reflect the new final position.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; - You should only need to update your portfolio model when you are creating a new asset type.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; - The portfolio model interacts with the Settlement model and fee model that are part of the brokerage model<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>What are fill models:<br>-Fill models control how each type of order is filled<br><br>Why are there fill models:<br>-To determine at what price orders are filled at and the quantity of fills (partial or full)<br>-To determine a price to fill limit orders<br>-To incorporate spread costs (if necessary)<br>-To work with the slippage model to add slippage into the fill price of orders<br>-To fill orders at the official Opening and Closing auction prices (for equities)<br><br>What fill models are supported (how do each of them determine the fill price?):<br>-ImmediateFillModel (default): Fills orders using the last trade price of the security<br>-LatestPriceFillModel: This fill model is provided because currently the data sourced for Crypto is limited to one minute snapshots for Quote data.
