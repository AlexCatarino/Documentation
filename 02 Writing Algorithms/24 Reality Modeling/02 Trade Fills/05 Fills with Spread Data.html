-In live trading, it's unlikely that your order fills at the last trade price of the security. 
<br>-To get the most realistic fill price, if your order enters or crosses the spread, the fill price should account for that.
<br>-The EquityFillModel is the default fill model to simulate order fills in backtests for Equity trades.
<br>-If you are subscribed to tick or quote data, the EquityFillModel sets the fill price of orders to be at the bid (when selling) or ask (when buying). If your data subscription doesn't have quote data, the EquityFillModel sets the fill price to be the close of the current TradeBar.
<br>-If you place MOO or MOC orders, the EquityFillModel fills at the official opening/closing auction price
