-Leverage is using borrowed money to increase your buying power.
<br>-Leverage has an inverse relationship with the margin requirement / maintenance margin
<br>-If you have a margin requirement of 50%, you can use up to 1 / 50% = 2 leverage.
<br>-Trading with leverage can be risky. It can boost returns on profitable trades but can make losing trades more expensive.
<br>-If you have $10,000 in your brokerage account and purchase $20,000 worth of securities in your margin account, you are trading with 2x leverage. If the value of the securities you purchased drops by 50%, you lose all of your equity.
