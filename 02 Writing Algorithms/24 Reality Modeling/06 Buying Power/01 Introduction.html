<p>Buying power models (also known as margin models) control how much buying power or leverage your portfolio has to make trades. When you place an order, LEAN uses the buying power model to determine whether the order should be send to the brokerage so you avoid placing orders that would be rejected by the brokerage. Buying power calculations can be very complex and depend on many factors, including the brokerage or even time of day. For example, the <code>PatternDayTradingMarginModel</code> lets you have 4x leverage during regular trading hours and 2x leverage during pre-market and post-market trading hours.</p>
