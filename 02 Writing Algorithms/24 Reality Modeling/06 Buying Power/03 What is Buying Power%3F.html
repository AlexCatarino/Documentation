<p>Buying power is the total amount of money you can spend in your brokerage account. For example, if you have $10,000 in cash and a margin requirement of 50%, you can spend $10,000 / 50% = $20,000 to buy securities. Since buying power is a function of your margin requirement and margin requirements vary by security, your buying power depends on the security you want to purchase.</p>
