-The total amount of money that you can spend in your brokerage account. 
<br>- For example, if you have $10,000 in cash and a margin requirement of 50%, you can spend $10,000 / 50% = $20,000 to buy securities.
<br>- Since buying power is a function of your margin requirement, and margin requirements vary by security, your buying power depends on the security you're trying to purchase.
