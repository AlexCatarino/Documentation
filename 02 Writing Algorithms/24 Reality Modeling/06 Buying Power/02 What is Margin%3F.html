<p>Margin is credit loan that your brokerage gives you for depositing collateral into your your brokerage margin account. You need margin to place short-biased trades and you can use margin to increase your buying power, but you incur interest fees. <span class="new-term">Margin</span> is the dollar-value of the loan that the brokerage gives you. A <span class="new-term">margin requirement</span> of 25% means that to purchase $10,000 worth of securities, you need at least $2,500 worth of collateral in your brokerage account to open the trade and you can borrow the rest on margin. <span class="new-term">Maintenance margin</span> is the minimum equity (equity = total portfolio value - borrowed funds) you must have in your brokerage account to stay in your positions. If the value of your portfolio falls below the maintenance margin, you receive a margin call. If you receive a margin call, you either need to add more capital to your brokerage account or the brokerage will liquidate some of your holdings to reduce your exposure and their risk.</p>
