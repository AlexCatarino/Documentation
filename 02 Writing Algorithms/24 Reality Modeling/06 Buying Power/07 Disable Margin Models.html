Buying power models (also known as margin models) control how much buying power (leverage) your algorithm has to make trades. Buying power calculations can be very complex and depend on many factors, including the brokerage or even time of day.
</p>
<p>
	Buying power models implement the $[IBuyingPowerModel, T:QuantConnect.Securities.IBuyingPowerModel] interface and default to the $[BuyingPowerModel, T:QuantConnect.Securities.BuyingPowerModel] class. If you wish to implement your own buying power model, you can start with the default and override methods you wish to change.

<p>
	We also provide the $[PatternDayTradingMarginModel,T:QuantConnect.Securities.PatternDayTradingMarginModel] to model intraday pattern day trading for US equities, which provides 4x intraday leverage and 2x overnight leverage.
