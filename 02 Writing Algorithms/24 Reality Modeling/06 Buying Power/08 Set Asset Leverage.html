<p>The buying power model sets the leverage for each security in your algorithm, but you can override its leverage settings after the buying power model is set.</p>

<p>To set the leverage when you create a security subscription, pass in a <code>leverage</code> argument.</p>
<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="csharp">// In Initialize
AddEquity("SPY", leverage: 3);</pre>
<pre class="python"># In Initialize
AddEquity("SPY", leverage=3)</pre>
</div>

<p>You can also set the asset leverage in a security initializer. In order to set the leverage of securities in the security initializer, call <code>SetSecurityInitializer</code> before you create security subscriptions and before you call SetBrokerageModel. If you pass in a <code>leverage</code> argument when you create the security subscription, the <code>leverage</code> argument takes precedence over the <code>SetLeverage</code> call in the security initializer.<br></p>

<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="csharp">// In Initialize
SetSecurityInitializer(CustomSecurityInitializer);
AddEquity("SPY");

private void CustomSecurityInitializer(Security security)
{
    security.SetLeverage(3);
}</pre>
<pre class="python"># In Initialize
self.SetSecurityInitializer(self.CustomSecurityInitializer)
AddEquity("SPY")

def CustomSecurityInitializer(self, security):
    security.SetLeverage(3)</pre>
</div>

<p>To set the leverage for all securities in a universe, set the <code>UniverseSettings.Leverage</code> property.</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
	<pre class="csharp">// In Initialize
UniverseSettings.Leverage = 3;</pre>
	<pre class="python"># In Initialize
self.UniverseSettings.Leverage = 3</pre>
</div>

In live trading, the leverage you set is not ignored. But if you set a different leverage from what your brokerage provides, it creates a mismatch between the buying power in the algorithm and given by the brokerage. If the value is greater than the leverage allowed by the brokerage, the orders will pass the validations in LEAN but can be rejected by the brokerage.
