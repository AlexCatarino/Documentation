Buying power models implement the $[IBuyingPowerModel, T:QuantConnect.Securities.IBuyingPowerModel] interface and default to the $[BuyingPowerModel, T:QuantConnect.Securities.BuyingPowerModel] class. If you wish to implement your own buying power model, you can start with the default and override methods you wish to change.
