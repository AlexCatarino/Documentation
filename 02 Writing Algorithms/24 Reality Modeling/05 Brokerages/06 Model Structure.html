-Brokerage brokerage models implement the IBrokerageModel interface. To implement your own brokerage model, you can start with the DefaultBrokerageModel and override methods as you wish to change.<br><div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="csharp">class MyBrokerage: DefaultBrokerageModel {
   // Custom implementation of brokerage here.
} 
</pre>
<pre class="python">class MyBrokerage(DefaultBrokerageModel):
   # Custom implementation of brokerage here.
</pre>
</div>

<p>Custom brokerage models give you enormous control over your algorithm behavior and allows you to model virtually any brokerage in the world.</p>
