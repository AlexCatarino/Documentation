We provide a shortcut to set common models and properties relating to each of the brokerages we support.

<br><div>-If you set a brokerage model, it override any other security-level models you may in your algorithm.</div><div>-To set a brokerage model, call the SetBrokerageModel method with a BrokerageName and an AccountType.<br> 

</div><div class="section-example-container">
	<pre class="csharp">// In Initialize
SetBrokerageModel(BrokerageName.OandaBrokerage); // Defaults to margin account
SetBrokerageModel(BrokerageName.Bitfinex, AccountType.Margin); // Overrides the default account type
</pre>
<pre class="python"># In Initialize
self.SetBrokerageModel(BrokerageName.OandaBrokerage) # Defaults to margin account
self.SetBrokerageModel(BrokerageName.Bitfinex, AccountType.Margin) # Overrides the default account type
</pre></div>

-In live trading your call SetBrokerageModel is not ignored. Some of the brokerage model rules are used to avoid placing orders that will be rejected by your real brokerage.
