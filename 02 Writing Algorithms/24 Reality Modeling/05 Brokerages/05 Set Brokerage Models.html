We provide a shortcut to set common models and properties relating to each of the brokerages we support.

<br><div>-If you set a brokerage model, it override any other security-level models you may in your algorithm.</div><div>-To set a brokerage model, call the SetBrokerageModel method with a BrokerageName and an AccountType.<br> 

</div><div class="section-example-container">
	<pre class="csharp">// Set brokerage model using helper methods:
SetBrokerageModel(BrokerageName.OandaBrokerage); // Defaults to margin account
SetBrokerageModel(BrokerageName.Bitfinex, AccountType.Margin); //Or override account type
</pre>
<pre class="python"># Set brokerage model using helper methods:
self.SetBrokerageModel(BrokerageName.OandaBrokerage) # Defaults to margin account
