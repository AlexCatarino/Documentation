<p>This page describes all of the pre-built settlement models in LEAN. For more brokerage-specific settlement models, see the <a href="https://www.quantconnect.com/docs/v2/our-platform/live-trading/brokerages">brokerage integration documentation pages</a>. If none of these models perform exactly how you want, create a <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/reality-modeling/settlement/key-concepts#04-Model-Structure">custom settlement model</a>.</p>
