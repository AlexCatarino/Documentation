<p>The brokerage model of your algorithm automatically sets the settlement model for each security. The default brokerage model is the <code>DefaultBrokerageModel</code>, which sets the <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/reality-modeling/settlement/supported-models#02-Immediate-Model'>ImmediateSettlementModel</a> in most cases. If you trade US Equities or Equity Options with a cash account, it sets the <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/reality-modeling/settlement/supported-models#03-Delayed-Model'>DelayedSettlementModel</a>.</p>

<p>The default delayed settlement rule for US Equity trades is T+3 at 8 AM Eastern Standard Time (EST). For example, if you sell on Monday, the trade settles on Thursday at 8 AM. The default delayed settlement rule for Future and Option contracts is T+1 at 8 AM.</p>
