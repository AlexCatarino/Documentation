<p>After you trade an asset, the brokerage needs to settle the funds in your account. The most common type of settlement is immediate, where the funds are immediately available for trading after the transaction. In some cases, you may have delayed settlement, where you sell an asset and need to wait a few days to spend cash you receive from the sale. A settlement model simulates these settlement rules. </p>
