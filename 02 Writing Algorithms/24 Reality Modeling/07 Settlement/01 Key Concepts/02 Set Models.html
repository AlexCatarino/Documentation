<p>The brokerage model of your algorithm automatically sets the settlement model for each security, but you can override it. To manually set the settlement model of a security, set the <code>SettlementModel</code> property on the <code>Security</code> object.</p>
<div class="section-example-container">
    <pre class="csharp">// In Initialize
var security = AddEquity("SPY");
// Set a delayed settlement model that settles 7 days after the trade at 8 AM
security.SettlementModel = new DelayedSettlementModel(7, new TimeSpan.FromHours(8, 0, 0));</pre>
    <pre class="python"># In Initialize
security = self.AddEquity("SPY")
# Set a delayed settlement model that settles 7 days after the trade at 8 AM
security.SettlementModel = DelayedSettlementModel(7, timedelta(hours=8))</pre>
</div>

<p>You can also set the settlement model in a security initializer. If your algorithm has a universe, use the security initializer technique. In order to initialize single security subscriptions with the security initializer, call <code>SetSecurityInitializer</code> before you create the subscriptions.</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="csharp">// In Initialize
SetSecurityInitializer(CustomSecurityInitializer);
AddEquity("SPY");

private void CustomSecurityInitializer(Security security)
{
    security.SettlementModel = new DelayedSettlementModel(7, new TimeSpan.FromHours(8, 0, 0));
}
</pre>
<pre class="python"># In Initialize
self.SetSecurityInitializer(self.CustomSecurityInitializer)
self.AddEquity("SPY")

def CustomSecurityInitializer(self, security):
    security.SettlementModel = DelayedSettlementModel(7, timedelta(hours=8))
</pre>
</div>
