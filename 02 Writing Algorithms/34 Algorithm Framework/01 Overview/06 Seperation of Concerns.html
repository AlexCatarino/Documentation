<div>What is seperation of concerns:</div><div>- A design principle where individual components in the algorithm are isolated and their responsibilities do not overlap. <br></div><div>- The algorithm framework is designed to follow the separation of concerns design principle. The individual framework components should not rely on the state of the other framework components in order to operate.</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp; - The models should not communicate. The universe and insights should be the same across different choices of PCM, RMM and EM. (https://github.com/QuantConnect/Documentation/issues/307)<br></div><div>- An common example of violating the separation of concerns principle is trying to flatten an insight in an alpha model after the risk management model has liquidated the security (to avoid re-buying the security)<br></div><div><br></div><div>What if your algorithm violates the separation of concerns design principle:</div><div>&nbsp;- It's more appropriate to use the classic algorithm design in this case instead of using the algorithm framework design.<br></div>
