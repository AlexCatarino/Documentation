<p>The separation of concerns principle is an algorithm design principle where individual components are isolated and their responsibilities don't overlap. The Algorithm Framework is designed to uphold this design principle. The individual framework components shouldn't rely on the state of the other framework components in order to operate.</p>

<p>In the Algorithm Framework, the models should not communicate. The universe constituents and <code>Insight</code> objects should be the same, regardless of what you select for the Portfolio Construction, Risk Management, and Execution models. A common example of violating the separation of concerns principle is flattening an <code>Insight</code> in an Alpha model after the Risk Management model has liquidated the security in order to avoid re-buying the security. If your algorithm logic naturally violates the separation of concerns design principle, it's more appropriate to use the classic or <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/algorithm-framework/hybrid-algorithms">hybrid design</a>.</p>
