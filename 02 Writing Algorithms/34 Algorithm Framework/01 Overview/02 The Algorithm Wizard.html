## ^ Update to Strategy Builder

<p>QuantConnect's <a href="https://www.quantconnect.com/terminal/" target="_blank">algorithm wizard</a> offers a growing number of premade framework modules. When you select a module in the wizard, you can see the full implementation in the second tab. Here are two examples of how one line of code can call for a premade universe class.</p>

<h5>Example: A Universe of Technology Stocks</h5>
<p>The Technology Universe Selection Model selects the most liquid stocks in the Nasdaq Stock Exchange. 
Through a combination of coarse and fine filtering on MorningStar data, it sorts all available symbols on dollar-volume and returns a sorted list of 1000 most liquid symbols.</p>
<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="prettyprint python">def Initialize(self):
    # Pass in a universe class of technology stocks 
    self.SetUniverseSelection(TechnologyUniverseModule())
</pre></div> 

<h5>Example: A Universe of Banking Stocks</h5>
<p>The Banking Stock Universe Selection Model selects the most liquid stocks in the Morningstar Bank Industry. This comprises all public US Equities classified as Banks and provides an industry-specific Universe for banking stocks.</p> 
<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="python">def Initialize(self):
    # Pass in a universe class of banking stocks 
    self.SetUniverseSelection(BankingIndustryStocks())
</pre></div>
