Generally, devs should choose Framework or Classic based on the algorithm needs. For example, algorithms that use stop market and limit orders are easier to implement using the classic approach. Additionally, if the developer needs to rewrite all modules or pass information between them, it would also be better to use the classic approach. In conclusion, the framework is better if you can reuse existing modules.
