<p>Since QuantConnect was formed in 2013, we've seen more than 2 million algorithms created by the community. Although they all seek to achieve different results, they can all be abstracted into the same core features. The Algorithm Framework is an attempt by QuantConnect to provide this well-defined structure to the community, encouraging good design and making your work more reusable.</p><p>These core "modules" – Universe Selection, Alpha Creation, Portfolio Construction, Execution and Risk Management – form the basis of all investment strategies.</p><p></p><ul><li>1. Universe Selection - Select your assets.</li><li>2. Alpha Creation - Generate trading signals.</li><li>3. Portfolio Construction - Determine position size targets.</li><li>4. Execution - Place trades to reach your position sizes.</li><li>5. Risk Management - Manage the market risks.</li></ul><p>In the following sections, we'll go into each of these modules in more detail.</p><p>## TODO: <br></p><p>- Add new h3: Manage securities with NotifiedSecurityChanges (C# only)</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Python version: self.securities += changes.AddedSecurities<br></p><p>- The `algorithm` passed to each of the components is the base QCAlgorithm class, not your subclass of it.<br></p>
