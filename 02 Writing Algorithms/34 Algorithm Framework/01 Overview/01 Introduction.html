<p>Since QuantConnect was formed in 2013, the community has created more than 2 million algorithms. Although they all seek to achieve different results, they can all be abstracted into the same core features. The Algorithm Framework is our attempt to provide this well-defined structure to the community, encouraging good design and making your work more reusable. The following table describes the core modules in the Algorithm Framework that form the basis of all investment strategies:</p>
