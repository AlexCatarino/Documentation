<p>The Algorithm Framework is the way we recommend you design strategies in QuantConnect in most cases. Following this well-defined structure gives many advantages over the classic algorithm design.</p>

<h4>Pluggable Algorithm Modules</h4>
<p>By using the Algorithm Framework, your code will be able to instantly utilize all modules built within the framework. The modules clip together in well-defined ways, which enable them to be shared and swapped interchangeably. </p>

<h4>Focus On Your Strengths</h4>
<p>By writing code in modules, you can focus on your strengths. If you are great at building universes, you can build universe modules. If you have risk-management experience, you could write reusable risk monitoring technology.</p>

<h4>Reduce Development By Using Community Modules</h4>
<p>Easily share modules you've made between algorithms or pull in ones produced by the community. The strict separation of duties makes the Algorithm Framework perfect for reusing code between strategies.</p>
