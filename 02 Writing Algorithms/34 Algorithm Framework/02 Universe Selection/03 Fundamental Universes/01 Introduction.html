<p>A <code>FundamentalUniverseSelectionModel</code> selects a universe of US Equities based on <code>CoarseFundamental</code> and (sometimes) <code>FineFundamental</code> data, so these Universe Selection models rely on the <a href="/datasets/quantconnect-us-coarse-universe-constituents">US Coarse Universe</a> dataset. If the Universe Selection model you use requires  <code>FineFundamental</code> data, you also need the <a href="/datasets/morning-star-us-fundamentals">US Fundamental</a> dataset.</p>

<p>These types of universes operate on daily schedule. In backtests, they select assets at midnight. In live trading, the selection timing depends on the <a href="/docs/v2/our-platform/live-trading/data-feeds">data feed</a> you use.</p>

<p>If you use a fundamental Universe Selection model, the only way to unsubscribe from a security is to return a list from the selection functions that doesn't include the security <code>Symbol</code>. The <code>RemoveSecurity</code> method doesn't work with these types of Universe Selection models.</p>
