<p>
Universe Models must implement a $[IUniverseSelectionModel,T:QuantConnect.Algorithm.Framework.Selection.IUniverseSelectionModel] interface. It has one method, $[CreateUniverses(QCAlgorithm algorithm),M:QuantConnect.Algorithm.Framework.Selection.UniverseSelectionModel.CreateUniverses]. The algorithm object is passed into the method to give you access to the QuantConnect API, and it should return an array of Universe objects.
</p>
<div class="section-example-container">
	<pre class="all">// Algorithm framework model that defines the universes to be used by an algorithm
interface IUniverseSelectionModel
{
   // Creates the universes for this algorithm, called once after IAlgorithm.Initialize
   IEnumerable&lt;Universe&gt; CreateUniverses(QCAlgorithmFramework algorithm);
}</pre>
</div>
<p>Generally, you should be able to extend one of the universes described above, so if you ever find yourself needing to do something that doesn't fit into the categories above, please let us know, and we'll create a new foundational type of universe model.</p><p>## TODO: <br></p><p>- CreateUniverses is called during PostInitialize(). Each timestep, OnFrameworkData is called, if it's time to refresh the universe (GetNextRefreshTimeUtc), then CreateUniverses is called again.<br></p>
