The algorithm framework allows adding multiple universe selection classes to your algorithm and subscribes to the constituents of all of them. Nothing special is required to achieve this - simply use the <code>AddUniverseSelection()</code> method to add each one. Below is an example of combining two Universe Selection Models to be used in one algorithm:

<div class="section-example-container">
	<pre class="csharp"></pre>
	<pre class="python"></pre>
</div>

<p>As many Universe Selection Models as required can be added to the algorithm.</p>
