<p><img src="https://cdn.quantconnect.com/web/i/docs/algorithm-framework/universe-selection.png" style="width:50px; float: left; margin-right:10px">The Universe Selection model creates <code>Universe</code> objects, which select the assets for your algorithm.
</p>

<p>In live trading, the securities in your brokerage account are added to your user-defined universe. If your universe selection model does not select these securities, they are not removed from your user-defined universe.</p>
# --
<br>---- You can see these securities during the OnWarmUpFinished event handler
<br>---- When you liquidate the positions, you can removed them from the user-defined universe. (if you call RemoveSecurity, it automatically liquidates the position)
