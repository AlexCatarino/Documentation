<p><img src="https://cdn.quantconnect.com/web/i/docs/algorithm-framework/universe-selection.png" style="width:50px; float: left; margin-right:10px"> The Universe Selection Model creates <code>Universe</code> objects which select the assets for your strategy. We have identified several types of universes that cover most people's requirements and built helper classes to make their implementation easier. Creating Universe Selection Models from scratch isn't simple, so we recommend you use one of the helper universes we've provided.

# --In live trading, the securities in your brokerage account are added to your user-defined universe. If your universe selection model does not select these securities, they are not removed from your user-defined universe.
