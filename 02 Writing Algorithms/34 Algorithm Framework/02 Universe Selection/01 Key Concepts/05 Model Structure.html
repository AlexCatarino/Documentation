<p>
Universe Selection models must implement the <code>IUniverseSelectionModel</code> interface. The interface has one method, <code>CreateUniverses</code>, which receives an <code>algorithm</code> object and returns an array of <code>Universe</code> objects.</p>
<div class="section-example-container">
	<pre class="all">// Algorithm framework model that defines the universes to be used by an algorithm
interface IUniverseSelectionModel
{
   // Creates the universes for this algorithm, called once after IAlgorithm.Initialize
   IEnumerable&lt;Universe&gt; CreateUniverses(QCAlgorithm algorithm);
}</pre>
</div>
<p>Generally, you should be able to extend one of the pre-built Universe Selection types. If you need to do something that doesn't fit into the pre-built types, let us know and we'll create a new foundational type of Universe Selection model.</p>
