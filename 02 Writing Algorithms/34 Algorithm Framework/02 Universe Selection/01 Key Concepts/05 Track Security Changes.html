When the universe selection model adjusts the universe constituents, we notify your algorithm through the OnSecuritiesChanged method on your other framework components. The method receives a QCAlgorithm and SecurityChanges objects. To access the added securities, check the changes.AddedSecurities property. To access the removed securities, check the changes.RemovedSecurities property.<br>

<div class="section-example-container">
	<pre class="csharp">public override void OnSecuritiesChanged(QCAlgorithm algorithm, SecurityChanges changes)
{
    foreach (var security in changes.AddedSecurities)
    {
        Log($"Added {security.Symbol}");
    }

    foreach (var security in changes.RemovedSecurities)
    {
        Log($"Removed {security.Symbol}");
    }
}</pre>
