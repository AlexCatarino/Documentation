This page describes the pre-built Risk Management models in LEAN. The number of models grows over time. To add a model to LEAN, make a pull request to the <a rel='nofollow' target='_blank' href="https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean/tree/master/Algorithm.Framework/Risk">GitHub repository</a>. If none of these models perform exactly how you want, create a custom Risk Management model.
