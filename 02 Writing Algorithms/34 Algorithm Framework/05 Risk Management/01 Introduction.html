<img src="https://cdn.quantconnect.com/web/i/docs/algorithm-framework/risk-management.png" style="width:50px; float: left; margin-right:10px"> The Risk Management Model seeks to manage risk on the $[PortfolioTarget,T:QuantConnect.Algorithm.Framework.Portfolio.PortfolioTarget] collection created by the Portfolio Construction Model. It is applied to the targets <i>before</i> they reach the Execution Model. There are many creative ways to manage risk. Some examples of this might be:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>"Trailing Stop Risk Management Model"</i><br> Seek to automatically create and manage trailing stop-loss orders for open positions.
</li>
	<li><i>"Option Hedging Risk Management Model"</i><br> Automatically purchase options to hedge large equity exposures.
</li>
	<li><i>"Sector Exposure Risk Management Model"</i><br>Seek to reduce position sizes when overexposed to sectors or individual assets, keeping the portfolio within diversification requirements.
</li>
	<li><i>"Flash Crash Detection Risk Management Model"</i><br>Scan for strange market situations which might be precursors to a flash crash and attempt to protect the portfolio when detected.
</li>
</ul>
<p>To set a Risk Management Model use the $[AddRiskManagement(),M:QuantConnect.Algorithm.QCAlgorithm.AddRiskManagement] method:
</p>
<div class="section-example-container">
	<pre class="python"> # Setting a risk management model
self.AddRiskManagement( NullRiskManagementModel() )</pre>
	<pre class="csharp">// Setting a risk management model
AddRiskManagement( new NullRiskManagementModel() );</pre>

## TODO: <br></div><div>- Add other supported models: https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean/tree/master/Algorithm.Framework/Risk</div><div>- Adding multiple risk management models to an algorithm (CompositeRiskManagementModel vs just calling AddRiskManagement)</div><div>- This is consumed by the execution model, which seeks to reach this 
target as efficiently as possible; you should not assume orders are 
filled immediately.</div>
