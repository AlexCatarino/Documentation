Alpha models are intended to be easy to create and the primary location for iterating your strategy. To create Alpha Models, you must implement the $[IAlphaModel,T:QuantConnect.Algorithm.Framework.Alphas.IAlphaModel] interface as shown in the examples below. This has two methods:
</p>
<p>1. $[Update(),M:QuantConnect.Algorithm.Framework.Alphas.AlphaModel.Update] - Generate Insight objects.<br>2. $[OnSecuritiesChanged(),M:QuantConnect.Algorithm.Framework.Alphas.AlphaModel.OnSecuritiesChanged] - Receive notifications about security changes.
</p>

You can access all the normal QCAlgorithm messages such as <code>Log</code>, and <code>Debug</code> from the algorithm object; for example logging is located at <code>algorithm.Log("message")</code>. The <code>slice</code> parameter contains the latest data available to the algorithm. <br></p><p><br></p><p>## TODO: <br></p><p>- The `algorithm` passed to the alpha:Update method isnâ€™t the algorithm object you defined on main as it doesn't include the user-defined attributes such as self.histories. In other words, we can only count with attributes of the base class (QCAlgorithm). We have two alternatives: 1. Use a Global variable; 2. Pass the reference to the object with the constructor. both alternatives violate the separation of concerns principle. <br></p><p>- These examples should subclass the AlphaModel class.</p><p>- Note that OnSecuritiesChanged is not required<br></p>
