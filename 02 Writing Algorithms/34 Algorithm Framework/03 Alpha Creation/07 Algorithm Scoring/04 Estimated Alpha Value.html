To assign an approximate value of the revenue potential for framework algorithms, we calculate the mean insight value. When an insight is created and successfully fulfills its expectations, there is potential for a profit. If an investor had followed the signal blindly and exited on completion of the insight period, the resulting gain or loss is the <i>Insight Value</i>. The insight value is calculated as:
</p>
<p><i>Insight Value = Insight Price Change x Volume Depth Available</i>
</p>
<p>The estimated algorithm hypothetical value is the sum of these insight values calculated on a monthly basis. Over time we hope to improve the Insight Value formulas to give you an estimate of potential Alpha Streams licensing revenues. It is important to note this is entirely hypothetical and the estimations are backwards-looking.</p>
