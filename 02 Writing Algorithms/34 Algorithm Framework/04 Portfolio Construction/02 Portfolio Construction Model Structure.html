<p>
Portfolio Construction Models have one primary method: $[CreateTargets(),M:QuantConnect.Algorithm.Framework.Portfolio.PortfolioConstructionModel.CreateTargets]. This method takes the algorithm object and a list of $[Insight,T:QuantConnect.Algorithm.Framework.Alphas.Insight] objects. You should seek to answer the question "how many shares/contracts should I buy based on the insight predictions I've been presented?"
</p>
<p>Like all Algorithm Framework models, the Portfolio Construction Model also receives the $[OnSecuritiesChanged(),M:QuantConnect.Algorithm.Framework.Portfolio.PortfolioConstructionModel.OnSecuritiesChanged] event, which can optionally be used to perform actions when there are security additions or removals. If you are inheriting from the $[PortfolioConstructionModel,T:QuantConnect.Algorithm.Framework.Portfolio.IPortfolioConstructionModel] base class, this is an optional method.

## TODO: Some portfolio construction models have an optimizer that accepts the historical returns, (optional) expected returns, and (optional) covariance matrix, and return a list of portfolio weights. They implement the IPortfolioOptimizer interface (C#, not Python because Python is not strongly typed)
