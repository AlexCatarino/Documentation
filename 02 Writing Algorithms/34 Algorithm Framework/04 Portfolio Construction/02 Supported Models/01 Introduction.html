This page describes the pre-built Portfolio Construction models in LEAN. The number of 
pre-built Portfolio Construction models grows over time. To add a pre-built Portfolio Construction model, 
make a pull request to the <a href="https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean/tree/master/Algorithm.Framework/Selection">LEAN repository</a>. If none of these models perform exactly how you want, create a custom Portfolio Construction model.<p></p>
