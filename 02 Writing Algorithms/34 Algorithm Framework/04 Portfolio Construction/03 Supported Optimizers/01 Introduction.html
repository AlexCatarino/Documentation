This page describes the pre-built portfolio optimizer models in LEAN. The number of 
pre-built portfolio optimizer  models grows over time. To add a pre-built portfolio optimizer model, 
make a pull request to the <a href="https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean/tree/master/Algorithm.Framework/Portfolio">LEAN repository</a>. If none of these models perform exactly how you want, create a custom portfolio optimizer model.<p></p>
