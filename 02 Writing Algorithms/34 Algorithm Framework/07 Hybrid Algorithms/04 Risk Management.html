Some risk management models don't require the PCM to provide 
PortfolioTarget objects. If you add one of these risk management models 
to a classic algorithm, it's a hybrid algorithm. To see which pre-built Risk 
Management models don't need on the PCM to return PortfolioTarget 
objects, see <a href="https://www.quantconnect.com/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/algorithm-framework/execution/supported-models">Supported Models</a>.
