<p>A hybrid algorithm is a classic algorithm with less than 5 framework models. An algorithm that uses all of the default framework models is not a hybrid algorithm. The hybrid algorithm design can be beneficial in the follow circumstances:</p>

<ul>
    <li>If you want to use a Universe Selection Model instead of a user-defined universe</li>
    <li>If you want to use a Portfolio Construction, Risk Management, or Execution model instead of manually placing and managing the orders in your algorithm</li>
    <li>If your algorithm logic naturally violates the separation of concerns design principle that the framework was designed to uphold</li>
</ul>
