<div>What is a hybrid algorithm?</div><div>- An algorithm that has the following characteristics:<br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - uses the NullAlphaModel as the only Alpha model<br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Emits insights with the EmitInsights method</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Has some other non-null framework model(s) set to execute/manage trades<br></div><div><br></div><div>Why use a hybrid algorithm:</div><div>- Some algorithms naturally violate the seperation of concerns design principle that the framework was designed for. In these cases, it's best to create a classic/hybrid algorithm</div><div>- If your classic algorithm has the NullPortfolioConstructionModel and <br></div><div>- If you want to use a risk management model with the default Alpha (NullAlphaModel) and PCM (NullPortfolioConstructionModel) </div><div><br></div><div><br></div><p>## TODO: we can write a classical algorithm and use the EmitInsights method to use the PCM/Execution/Risk and/or use AddUniverse.</p><p><br></p><p>You can add just the RiskManagement model (ex: max drawdown) and it will work because some RiskManagement models don't need the PCM to provide PortfolioTarget objects. To see which Risk Management models don't need on the PCM to return PortfolioTarget objects, see <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/algorithm-framework/execution/supported-models">Supported Models</a>. <br></p>
