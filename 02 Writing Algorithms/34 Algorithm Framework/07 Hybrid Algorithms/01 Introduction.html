<p>A hybrid algorithm is a classic algorithm with less than 5 framework models. An algorithm that uses all of the default framework models is not a hybrid algorithm. The hybrid algorithm design can be beneficial in the follow circumstances:</p>

<ul>
    <li>If you want to use <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/algorithm-framework/universe-selection/key-concepts'>Universe Selection models</a> instead of a <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/universes/key-concepts'>user-defined universe</a></li>
    <li>If you want to use a Portfolio Construction, Risk Management, or Execution Model instead of manually placing and managing the orders in your algorithm</li>
    <li>If your algorithm logic naturally violates the separation of concerns design principle that the framework was designed to uphold</li>
</ul>
