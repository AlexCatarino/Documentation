<p>## TODO: we can write a classical algorithm and use the EmitInsights method to use the PCM/Execution/Risk and/or use AddUniverse.</p><p><br></p><p>You can add just the RiskManagement model (ex: max drawdown) and it will work because some RiskManagement models don't need the PCM to provide PortfolioTarget objects. To see which Risk Management models don't need on the PCM to return PortfolioTarget objects, see <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/algorithm-framework/execution/supported-models">Supported Models</a>. <br></p>
