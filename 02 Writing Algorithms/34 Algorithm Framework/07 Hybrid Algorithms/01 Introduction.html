<div>What is a hybrid algorithm?</div><div>- An algorithm that adds framework models to a classic algorithm.<br></div><div><br></div><div>- For example, some risk management models don't require the PCM to provide PortfolioTarget objects. If you add one of these risk management models to a classic algorithm, it's a hybrid algorithm. To see which Risk Management models don't need on the PCM to return PortfolioTarget objects, see <a href="https://www.quantconnect.com/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/algorithm-framework/execution/supported-models">Supported Models</a>. <br></div><div><br></div><div>- Another example: Using Universe Selection model in your classic algorithm instead of just adding a user-defined Universe.<br></div><div><br></div><div>- Another example: You can add a PCM to your classic algorithm and use the EmitInsights method instead of placing manual orders with MarketOrder<br></div><div><br></div><div>What is not a hybrid algorithm:</div><div>- An algorithm that uses all of the default framework models</div><div>- An algorithm that has the following characteristics:<br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Uses a universe selection models instead of a user-defined universe</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Uses an Alpha model that isn't the NullAlphaModel<br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Uses a PCM that isn't the NullPortfolioConstructionModel</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Has no classic-style trade logic in the QCAlgorithm class.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Why use a hybrid algorithm:</div><div>- Some algorithms naturally violate the seperation of concerns design principle that the framework was designed for. In these cases, it's best to create a classic/hybrid algorithm</div><div>- If you want to use a riskmanagementmodel in your classic algorithm instead of implementing the logic yourself.<br></div>
