<p>In some cases, if you add a Risk Management model that uses stop loss logic, the Risk Management model generates <code>PortfolioTarget</code> objects with a 0 quantity to make the Execution model liquidate your positions, but and then the Portfolio Construction model generates <code>PortfolioTarget</code> objects with a non-zero quantity to make the Execution model re-enter the same position. This issue can occur if your Portfolio Construction model rebalances and your Alpha model still has an active insight for the liquidated securities. To avoid this issue, add the stop loss order logic to the Alpha model. When the stop loss is hit, emit a flat insight for the security.</p>
