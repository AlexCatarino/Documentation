<p>In some cases, if you add a Risk Management model that uses stop loss orders, the Risk Management model liquidates your positions and then re-enters the same position. This issue can occur if your Portfolio Construction model rebalances and your Alpha model still has an active insight for the liquidated securities. To avoid this issue, add the stop loss order logic to the Alpha model. When the stop loss is hit, emit a flat insight for the security.</p>
