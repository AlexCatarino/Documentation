    The Alpha Model is primarily concerned with predicting market trends and signalling to the algorithm the best moments for making an investment. These signals, or $[Insight,T:QuantConnect.Algorithm.Framework.Alphas.Insight] objects, contain the Direction, Magnitude, and Confidence of a market prediction. Insights should be generated on a defined set of assets provided by the Universe Selection Model and only emitted when they change.
