This page describes the pre-built Alpha models in LEAN. The number of pre-built Alpha models grows over time. To add a pre-built Alpha model, make a pull request to the <a href='https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean/tree/master/Algorithm.Framework/Alphas'>LEAN repository</a>. If none of these models perform exactly how you want, create a custom Alpha model.
