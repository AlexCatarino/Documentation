<p>The PearsonCorrelationPairsTradingAlphaModel ranks every pair combination by its pearson correlation and trades the pair with the highest correlation. This model follows the same insight logic as the BasePairsTradingModel.<br></p>

The model accepts the following arguments:
<br>-lookback: lookback period of the analysis; default 15
<br>-resolution: analysis resolution; default Resolution.Minute
<br>-threshold: The percent [0, 100] deviation of the ratio from the mean before emitting an insight; Default 1
<br>-minimumCorrelation: The minimum correlation to consider a tradable pair; default 0.5
