The BasePairsTradingAlphaModel analyzes every possible pair combination from securities selected by the universe selection model. The model generates alternating long ratio/short ratio insights emitted as a group. It calculates the mean ratio between the two securities by dividing their historical prices and taking the 500-period EMA of the quotient.<br><br>
The model accepts the following arguments:
<br>-lookback: Lookback period of the analysis; Default 1
<br>-resolution: Analysis resolution; Default Resolution.Daily
<br>-threshold: The percent [0, 100] deviation of the ratio from the mean before emitting an insight; Default 1
