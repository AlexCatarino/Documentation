<p>You can add multiple Alpha models to a single algorithm and generate Insight objects with all of them.
</p>
<div class="section-example-container">
	<pre class="csharp">AddAlpha(new RsiAlphaModel());
AddAlpha(new EmaCrossAlphaModel());</pre>
	<pre class="python">self.AddAlpha(RsiAlphaModel())
self.AddAlpha(EmaCrossAlphaModel())</pre>
</div>

<p>Each Alpha model has a unique name. The Insight objects they generate are automatically named according to the Alpha model name.</p>

<p>If you add multiple Alpha models, each alpha model receives the current slice in the order that you add the Alphas. The combined stream of Insight objects is passed to the Portfolio Construction model.</p>
