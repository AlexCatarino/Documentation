<p>    The Execution Model is primarily concerned with efficiently executing trades. It seeks to find the optimal price to fill orders and manages the orders. It receives a $[PortfolioTarget,T:QuantConnect.Algorithm.Framework.Portfolio.IPortfolioTarget] array from the <a class="docs-internal-link" href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/algorithm-framework/risk-management/key-concepts">Risk Management Model</a> and uses it to place trades in the market, seeking to reach the units indicated in the Portfolio Target. <br></p>
<p>When the targets arrive at the Execution Model, they have already been risk-adjusted by the Risk Management Model. Like all models, the Execution Model only receives <i>updates</i> to the portfolio target share counts. You will not receive all the targets at once.
