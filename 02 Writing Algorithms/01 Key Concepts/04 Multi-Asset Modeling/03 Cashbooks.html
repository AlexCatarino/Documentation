-LEAN also is designed to be a multi-currency platform. Because of that, LEAN is able to trade forex, cryptocurrencies, and other assets that are quoted in other currencies. For example, as we add new asset classes from new countries, LEAN is already prepared to transact in those assets by using their quote currency. We have added the India Equity market, which quotes assets in the INR currency.
