<p>We designed LEAN to be a multi-currency platform. LEAN can trade Forex, Cryptocurrencies, and other assets that are quoted in other currencies. A benefit of supporting multiple currencies is that as we add new asset classes from new countries, LEAN is already prepared to transact in those assets by using their quote currency. For instance, we added the India Equity market, which quotes assets in the INR currency.</p>

<p>The portfolio manages your currencies in its cashbook, which models the cash as a ledger of transactions. When you buy assets, LEAN uses the currencies in your cashbook to purchase the asset and pay the transaction fees. For more information about the cashbook, see <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/portfolio/cashbook">Cashbook</a>.</p>
