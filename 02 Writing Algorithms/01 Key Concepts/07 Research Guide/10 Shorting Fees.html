<div>What are shorting fees:</div><div>- Paying interest to borrow shares to enter short positions<br></div><div><br></div><div>Why shorting fees matter:<br></div><div>-Wang et al. (2014) show that some factors have a larger edge for long positions and some have a larger edge for short positions.</div><div>-For factors that have an edge for short positions, borrowing shares to short can be very expensive or impossible. </div>-Wang et al. (2014) found that the factors that perform better on the short side usually target more securities that are on hard-to-borrow lists than factors that perform better on the long side. Their research also shows that a large part of the returns from these short-biased factors come from securities that are on hard-to-borrow lists. If you don't account for short availability, your backtest results can be unrealistic and not reproducible in live trading.<br><div><br></div><div>To avoid issues with shorting fees/availability:</div><div>- You can use the AtreyuShortableProvider to see if there are currently shares available to short</div><div>-Lean doesn't currently model short borrowing fees., so your backtests 
will have inflated performance if you are shorting. Subscribe to GitHub
