<p>Outliers in a dataset can have large impacts on how models train. In some cases, you may leave outliers in a dataset because they can contain useful information. In other cases, you may want to transform the data to handler the outlier data points. There are several common methods to handle outliers.</p>

<h4>Winsorization Method</h4>
<p>The winsorization method removes outliers at the \(x\)% of the extremes. For example, if you winsorize at 1%, it removes the 1% data points with the lowest value and the 1% of data points with the highest value. The threshold percentage is subjective, so it can result in overfitting.</p>

<h4>IQR Method</h4>
<p>The interquartile range method removes data points that fall outside of the interval \( [Q_1 - k (Q_3 - Q_1), Q_3 + k (Q_3 - Q_1)] \) for some constant \(k &gt;= 0\). This method can exclude up to 25% of observations on each side of the extremes. The interquartile range method doesn't work if the data is skewed or non-normal. Therefore, the disadvantage to this method is you need to review the factor distribution properties. If you need to, you can normalize the data with z-scores.</p>

\[Z = frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}\]


<h4>Factor Ranking Method</h4>
<p></p>



<br><br><div>-Factor ranking method</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Taking the rank of the factor relative to the other securities, rather than taking the raw factor value.<br></div>&nbsp;&nbsp; - This method transforms the data into a uniform distribution.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; - After converting to a uniform distribution, Wang et al. perform an inverse normal transformation to make the factors normally distributed.<br><br>-Wang et al. research finds that the ranking transformation outperforms the z-score transformation, suggesting that the distance between factor scores doesn't add information (just noise), only the ranking matters.<p></p>
