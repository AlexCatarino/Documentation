<p>-Periods (Bars) have a start and end time that represents the time that the bar was constructed.<br></p><p>-Start time is the start of the bar and end time is the end of the bar.</p><p>-The bar is passed into your algorithm at the end time to ensure there is no look-ahead bias -- so that you don't receive the bar before it was actually available. <br></p><p>-Other data providers commonly timestamp their bars to the start time of the bar. This can cause one-off errors when you import into QC or are checking the values of indicators across different platforms.<br></p><p>-OnEndOfDay is called at the end of each day in your algorithms.<br></p>
