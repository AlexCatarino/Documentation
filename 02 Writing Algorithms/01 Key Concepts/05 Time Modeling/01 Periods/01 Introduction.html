The core technology behind QuantConnect algorithmic trading is an event-based, streaming analysis system called <a href="https://www.lean.io" target="_BLANK">LEAN</a>. LEAN attempts to model the stream of time as accurately as possible, presenting data ("events") to your algorithms in the order it arrives, as you would experience in reality.

<p>All QuantConnect algorithms have this time-stream baked in as the primary event handler: <code>OnData(slice)</code>. The <code>Slice</code> object represents all of the data at a moment of time, a <i>"time-slice"</i>. No matter what data you request, you receive it in the order created according to simulated algorithm time. By only letting your algorithm see the present and past moments, we can prevent the most common quantitative-analysis error, <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lookaheadbias.asp" target="_BLANK">look-ahead bias</a>.
