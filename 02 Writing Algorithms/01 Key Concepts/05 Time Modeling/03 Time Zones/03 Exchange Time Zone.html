<p>Exchanges are located in different areas, so they can have different time zones. To get the timezone of the exchange that a security trades on, use the <code>Exchange.Hours</code> property of the <code>Security</code> object.</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="python">var timezone = Securities["SPY"].Exchange.Hours.TimeZone;</pre>
<pre class="csharp">timezone = self.Securities["SPY"].Exchange.Hours.TimeZone</pre>
</div>
