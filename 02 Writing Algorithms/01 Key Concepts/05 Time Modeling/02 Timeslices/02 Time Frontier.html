<p>If you request data for multiple securities and multiple resolutions, it can create a situation where one of your data subscriptions is ready to emit, but another subscription with a longer period is still be constructing its bar. To coordinate this data, we use the <code>EndTime</code> of each data point to signal when LEAN should transmit it to your algorithm.</p>

<p>Once the <code>EndTime</code> of a data point is reached, LEAN sends the data to your <code>OnData</code> method. For bar data, this is the beginning of the next period. To avoid look-ahead bias, you can only access data from before this Time Frontier.</p>

<p>The <code>Time</code> property of your algorithm is always equal to the Time Frontier. This time is also the timestamp for <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/logging">log and debug messages</a>.</p>
