-The slice passed to OnData vs self.CurrentSlice<br><p>

Data comes in two different "shapes" according to the time period it covers: point values, or period values. These have different properties in LEAN which determine when the data is emitted to your algorithm. The coordination of emitting this data is controlled by the <i>Time Frontier</i>.
In QuantConnect, Ticks are point values, and Bars have a period.</p>
