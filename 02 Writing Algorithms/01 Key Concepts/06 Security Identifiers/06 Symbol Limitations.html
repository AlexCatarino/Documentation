The downside of Symbols is that it requires knowledge of the initial listing ticker string. In the example above, the initial ticker GOOCV is eventually renamed/mapped into the GOOG class C-shares. QuantConnect is working to also support other identification methods (CUSIP / ISIN / Open-FIGI), but for now, Symbols allow unique identification and free distribution of the LEAN project without references to external data.

## TODO: We have already added support for getting a Lean symbol based on FIGI, CUSIP, ISIN, SEDOL. See https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean/pull/5922
