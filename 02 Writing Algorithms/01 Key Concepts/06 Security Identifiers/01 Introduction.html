<p><code>Symbol</code> objects are a way to uniquely identify an asset. They are objects which contain all the information required to identify a security without needing external references or proprietary database look-ups. Symbols were implemented in the LEAN open-source project as a way to identify or "finger-print" tradable assets so that no further database look-up is required.

All QuantConnect and LEAN Algorithm API methods use Symbols to identify the asset for trading.
