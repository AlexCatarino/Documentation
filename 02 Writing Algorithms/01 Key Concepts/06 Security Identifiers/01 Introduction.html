<p><code>Symbol</code> objects are a way to uniquely identify an asset. They contain all the required information to identify a security without needing external references or proprietary database look-ups. We implemented <code>Symbol</code> objects in the LEAN open-source project as a way to identify or "finger-print" tradable assets so that no further database look-up is required. All QuantConnect and LEAN Algorithm API methods use <code>Symbol</code> objects to identify assets.</p>
