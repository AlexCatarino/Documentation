    $[Ticks,T:QuantConnect.Data.Market.Tick] data provides LastPrice and Quantity properties for a given time. If it is a quote tick, it also contains non-zero BidPrice, BidSize, AskPrice, and AskSize properties. A Trade Tick is a record of a transaction or sale for the security. A Quote Tick is a bid or offer to purchase the security for a specific price. For equities, all of the ticks for given second are grouped together in backtesting. In live trading, ticks are streamed directly to your algorithm as soon as they occur. Data with millisecond resolution timestamps (Forex, CFD, and Futures) generally only have 1 tick in their list, but when multiple trades occur within a millisecond they may also be grouped together.

Tick data is raw and unfiltered. It may contain bad ticks which skew your trade results. We recommend only using tick data if you understand the risks and are able to perform your own online tick filtering. Ticks which QuantConnect believes are suspicious are marked with the boolean <code>Suspicious</code> flag. <br></p><p>## TODO: Add TickType, ExchangeCode, Exchange, SaleCondition, ParsedSaleCondition, SetValue(), IsValid(), ToString()<br></p>
