What is algorithmic trading?<br><p>

Quantitative trading is a method of trading where computer programs execute a set of defined trading rules in an automated fashion. Quants take a scientific approach to trading, applying concepts from mathematics, time series analysis, statistics, computer science, and machine learning. Compared to discretionary traders, quants can respond faster to new information and are at less risk to their emotions during trades. Additionally, since quants can concurrently trade many strategies while discretionary traders only have the mental bandwidth to trade a small number of concurrent strategies, quant traders can have more diversified portfolios.
