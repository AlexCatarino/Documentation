  <li>What is the relationship of QuantConnect to LEAN?</li>
  <p>Lean is maintained by QuantConnect and drives the web-based algorithmic trading platform QuantConnect.com.</p>
  <li>We could talk about avoiding vendor lock-in</li>

What are the supported programming languages?</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;- Python and C#</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; - If you program in Python, LEAN uses Python.Net to bridge between the C# engine and your algorithm. It can be slow to move from Python to C#. If you access C# objects in your Python algorithm, it's fastest to only access them once and save a reference (for example, self.Securities[symbol].Close.)</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; - If your Python algortihm subsclasses a C# class, the constructor must include `super().__init__`</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; - # example code snippet from https://www.quantconnect.com/forum/discussion/13699/what-does-pythonnet-update-mean-to-your-algorithms/p1<br></p>
