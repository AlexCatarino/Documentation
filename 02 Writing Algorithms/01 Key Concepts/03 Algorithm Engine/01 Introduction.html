<p>LEAN Engine is an open-source algorithmic trading engine built for easy strategy research, backtesting and live trading. We integrate with common data providers and brokerages, so you can quickly deploy algorithmic trading strategies. The core of the LEAN Engine is written in C#, but it operates seamlessly on Linux, Mac and Windows operating systems. It supports algorithms written in Python 3.6 or C#. LEAN is maintained by QuantConnect and it drives the web-based algorithmic trading platform QuantConnect.com.</p>

<p>Since LEAN is open-source, you are not locked-in to the QuantConnect platform. You can run LEAN with your own infrastructure, data, and brokerage connections. If you use QuantConnect, our team of engineers manage the infrastructure, you can run the latest version of LEAN with all of its brokerage connections, and you can utilize the datasets in the <a href="/datasets">Dataset Market</a>.</p>
