<p>LEAN Engine is an open-source algorithmic trading engine built for easy strategy research, backtesting and live trading. We integrate with common data providers and brokerages, so you can quickly deploy algorithmic trading strategies. The core of the LEAN Engine is written in C#, but it operates seamlessly on Linux, Mac and Windows operating systems. It supports algorithms written in Python 3.6 or C#. Lean is maintained by QuantConnect and drives the web-based algorithmic trading platform QuantConnect.com.</p>



<p>-Lean is brokerage-agnostic, you can use the same algorithm for different brokerages. <br></p>



We could talk about avoiding vendor lock-in
