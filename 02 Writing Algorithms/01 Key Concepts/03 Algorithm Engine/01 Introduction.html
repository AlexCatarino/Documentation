<p>LEAN Engine is an open-source algorithmic trading engine built for easy strategy research, backtesting, and live trading. We integrate with common data providers and brokerages, so you can quickly deploy algorithmic trading strategies. The core of the LEAN Engine is written in C#, but it operates seamlessly on Linux, Mac and Windows operating systems. To use it, you can write algorithms in Python 3.6 or C#. QuantConnect maintains the LEAN project and uses it to drive the web-based algorithmic trading platform on the website.</p>

<p>Since LEAN is open-source, you aren't locked-in to the QuantConnect platform. You can run LEAN with your own infrastructure, data, and brokerage connections. If you use QuantConnect, our team of engineers manage the infrastructure, you can run the latest version of LEAN with all of its brokerage connections, and you can utilize the datasets in the <a href="/datasets">Dataset Market</a>.</p>
