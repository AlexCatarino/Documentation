<div>- The LEAN engine is written in C# but you can create algorithms in C# or Python.<br></div><div><br></div><div>- If you program in Python, LEAN uses Python.Net to bridge between 
the C# engine and your algorithm. It can be slow to move from Python to 
C#. If you access C# objects in your Python algorithm, it's fastest to 
only access them once and save a reference (for example, 
self.Securities[symbol].Close.)</div><div><br></div>
