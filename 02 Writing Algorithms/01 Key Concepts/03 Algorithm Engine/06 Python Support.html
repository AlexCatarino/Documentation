<p>The LEAN engine is written in C#, but you can create algorithms in C# or Python. If you program in Python, LEAN uses Python.Net to bridge between the C# engine and your algorithm. As a result of the bridge, <code>QCAlgorithm</code> class members are in camel case, not snake case. It can be slow to move from Python to C#. If you access C# objects in your Python algorithm, it's fastest to only access them once and save a reference if you need to access them again.</p>
