<p>- Event flow: Scheduled events =&gt; consolidator event handlers =&gt; OnData.</p>

<p>Scheduled events in live mode runs in a parallel thread while they belong to the main algorithm manager loop in backtesting.</p><p>In backtesting, if you have a scheduled event set for 8PM but you only receive data at midnight, the algorithm manager will receive the data at midight and look back in time to see if there are any scheduled events that it needs to fire. It will fire the scheduled event with the timestamp of 8PM<br></p>

Live trading considerations
<br>Test if set a scheduled event for 10:00AM in a backtest and compare the Security[symbol].Price. Is it from the back that closes at 10AM?
