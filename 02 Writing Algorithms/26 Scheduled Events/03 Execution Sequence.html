<p>Scheduled events in live mode runs in a parallel thread while they belong to the main algorithm manager loop in backtesting.</p><p>In backtesting, if you have a scheduled event set for 8PM but you only receive data at midnight, the algorithm manager will receive the data at midight and look back in time to see if there are any scheduled events that it needs to fire.
