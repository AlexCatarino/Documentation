	Scheduled events allow you to trigger code to run at specific times of day. This happens regardless of your data events. The schedule API requires a date and time rule to specify when the event is fired.
</p>
<p>
	Scheduled events need a $[DateRules,T:QuantConnect.Scheduling.DateRules] and $[TimeRules,T:QuantConnect.Scheduling.TimeRules] pair to set a specific time. When the event is triggered, the code block is executed.
