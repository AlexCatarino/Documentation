<p>Scheduled Events let you trigger code to run at specific times of day, regardless of your algorithm's data subscriptions. </p>



<p>What are Scheduled Events?<br>
	</p><p>- Scheduled events allow you to trigger code to run at specific times of day. This happens regardless of your data events. The schedule API requires a date and time rule to specify when the event is fired.</p><p><br></p><p>Why use scheduled events?</p><p>- More reliable than relying on time
	Accounts for market open timing.<br>- Easier to control time-based events than using if-conditions statements in OnData;</p><p><br></p><p>How to use scheduled events:</p><p>- Scheduled events need a $[DateRules,T:QuantConnect.Scheduling.DateRules] and $[TimeRules,T:QuantConnect.Scheduling.TimeRules] pair to set a specific time. When the event is triggered, the code block is executed.
