<p>A <code>RollingWindow</code> is a array of a fixed-size that holds trailing data. It's more efficient to use RollingWindow objects to hold periods of data instead of making multiple historical data requests. With a RollingWindow, you just update the latest data point, while a History call fetches the whole requested period and synchronizes the data.</p>
