<p>RollingWindow objects operate on a first-in, first-out process to allow for reverse list access semantics. Index 0 refers to the most recent item in the window and index <span class="latex-variable">Length</span>-1 refers to the last item in the window, where <span class="latex-variable">Length</span> is the number of elements in the window.</p>
<div class="section-example-container">
	<pre class="csharp">var currentClose = closeWindow[0];
var previousClose = closeWindow[1];
var oldestClose = closeWindow[closeWindow.Count-1];</pre>
	<pre class="python">current_close = self.close_window[0]
previous_close = self.close_window[1]
oldest_close = self.close_window[self.close_window.Count-1]</pre>
</div>

## Add MostRecentlyRemoved: Gets the most recently removed item from the window. This is the piece of data that just 'fell off' as a result of the most recent add. If no items have been removed, this will throw an exception.
