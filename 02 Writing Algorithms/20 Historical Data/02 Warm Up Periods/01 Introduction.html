There are two ways to request historical data in your algorithms, direct historical data requests and indirect algorithm warm up. Indirect algorithm warm-up winds back the start time of your algorithm and feeds it with historical data, simulating a real data feed. Warm-up is best for quickly restoring the state of a fixed set of assets.

<p>In addition to the methods for manually requesting history above, QuantConnect also supports an automated "fast-forward" system called "Warm Up" which simulates winding back the clock from the time the algorithm is deployed. In a backest, this is the StartDate of your algorithm. Warm Up is a great way to prepare indicators for relatively simple strategies, but if you have a dynamic universe of assets we recommend manually requesting historical data when required. </p>
