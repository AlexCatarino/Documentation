Algorithm warm-up is useful if you have a streaming algorithm which can incrementally build algorithm state. However, it has several limitations:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Trades cannot be performed during warm-up as they would impact the algorithm portfolio and would be trading on fictional fast-forwarded data.</li>
<li>Due to technical limitations, universe selection cannot be fast-forwarded. Any universe selection is skipped until real-time is reached. If you create subscriptions with AddEquity, AddCrypto, AddForex, AddIndex, or AddCfd, your OnData method will receive warm-up data for these securities, but OnSecuritiesChanged isn't called until the start date of your algorithm. If you create subscriptions with a universe selection model, AddFuture, AddOption, AddFutureOption, AddIndexOption, it won't start selecting contracts/assets until your algorithm start date.<br></li>
<li>Scheduled events aren't called during warm-up.</li>
</ul>
