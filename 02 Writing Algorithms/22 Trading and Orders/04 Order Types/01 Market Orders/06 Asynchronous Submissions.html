When trading on a large portfolio of assets, you may wish to send orders in batches and not wait for the response to each one. This is possible by setting the optional argument <code>asynchronous</code> to true.

<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="csharp">// Create a Market Order for 100 shares of IBM asynchronously.
MarketOrder("IBM", 100, asynchronous: true);
</pre>
<pre class="python"> # Create a Market Order for 100 shares of IBM asynchronously. 
self.MarketOrder("IBM", 100, True)
</pre>
</div>
