<p>
When you place a market on open or close order, you do not know its fill price until after the order is completed. If your order quantity is too close to your total portfolio buying power, you have a high chance of it being rejected as there may be large changes in price overnight. We recommend you consider this when sizing your portfolio to increase your probability of successful trades.
