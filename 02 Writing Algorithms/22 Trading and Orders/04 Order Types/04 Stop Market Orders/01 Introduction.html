Why not use a stop market order?
<br>-If the market gaps (jumps in a discontinuous manner) past your stop price, it may be filled at a substantially worse price than the stop price you entered. As such, a stop-loss order is no guarantee your trade will fill at the price you specify.
<br>-If your stop is triggered but the price rebounds, the stop loss can cause you to miss out on profit. (close a trade early)
