Often we are asked to support other order types such as Multi-Leg, One Cancels All, and Trailing Stop. Currently these order types are not supported, but will be added over time. Part of the difficulty of implementing them is the incomplete brokerage support.

## TODO: Add OCO, OptionStrategies order types here. One h3 each?
