What are limit orders:
<br>-Limit orders are instructions to trade a specific number of units at a specific price or a better price.

<br><br>
Why use limit orders:
<br>-In contrast to market orders, limit orders have a set price that they must fill at (or better). If you place a marketable limit order (on that crosses the spread) instead of a market order, you know ahead of time what the worst fill price is you can receive (even though your order may not fill completely).
<br>-They are helpful in this case for illiquid markets
<br>-If you place an unmarketable limit order, it saves you from paying the spread costs.

Some brokerages may charge you a lower transaction fee as well (Maker fee instead of the Taker fee)<br><br>
Why not use limit orders:
<br>-If the market trades away from your limit price, you may have to wait for the market to trade back to your limit order to get filled, or you may have to adjust your limit order. If you place an unmarketable limit order (one that doesn't cross the spread), there is a chance that you end up filling at a worse price than if you were to just use a market order initially.
