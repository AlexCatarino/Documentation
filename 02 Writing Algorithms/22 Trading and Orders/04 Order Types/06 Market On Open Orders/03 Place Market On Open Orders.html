- You must submit Market On Open orders two minutes before the market opens to be included in the opening auction. 
<br>-If you place a regular market order when the exchange is closed, your order is converted to a MOO order automatically. To override this behaviour, create a custom fill model (example: https://www.quantconnect.com/forum/discussion/10840/backtest-pre-market-order-submitted-immediately-but-filled-at-9-30/p1/comment-31095). To be notified when the default fill model allows you to submit market orders outside of regular trading hours, subscribe to https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean/issues/3947
