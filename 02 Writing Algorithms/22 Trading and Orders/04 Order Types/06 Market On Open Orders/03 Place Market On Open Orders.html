- You must submit Market On Open orders two minutes before the market opens to be included in the opening auction. 
<br><div>-If you place a regular market order when the exchange is closed, your order is converted to a MOO order automatically. To override this behaviour, create a custom fill model (example: https://www.quantconnect.com/forum/discussion/10840/backtest-pre-market-order-submitted-immediately-but-filled-at-9-30/p1/comment-31095). To be notified when the default fill model allows you to submit market orders outside of regular trading hours, subscribe to https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean/issues/3947 <br></div><div><br></div><p>
To send a market on open order, you must provide a symbol and quantity. If you do not have sufficient capital for the order, it is rejected.<br></p>

<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="csharp">// Buy 100 shares of IBM at the market open
buy_ticket = MarketOnOpenOrder("IBM", 100);

// Sell 100 shares of IBM at the market open
sell_ticket = MarketOrder("IBM", -100);</pre>
<pre class="python"># Buy 100 shares of IBM at the market open
var buyTicket = self.MarketOnOpenOrder("IBM", 100)

# Sell 100 shares of IBM at the market open
var sellTicket = self.MarketOrder("IBM", -100)</pre>
