<div>When are options exercised?
<br>-Our platform lets you trade American style Options, so you can exercise Option contracts before the expiration date.
<br>-You would only want to exercise an option if it's in-the-money, 
otherwise you would lose money. If your call option contract is 
out-of-the-money, you can buy the underlying shares cheaper in the stock
 market than you would buy them for if you exercised the option.
