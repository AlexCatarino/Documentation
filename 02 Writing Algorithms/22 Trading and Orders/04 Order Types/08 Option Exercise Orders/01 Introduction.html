What are option exercise orders:
<br>-If you bought a call option contract, you can exercise your right to purchase the underlying shares at the strike price.
<br>-If you bought a put option contract, you can exercise your right to sell the underlying shares at the strike price.
<br>-If you sold a call option contract, and the buyer exercises their right to purchase the underlying shares, you must sell them the shares at the strike price.
<br>-If you sold a put option contract, and the buyer exercises their right to sell the underlying shares, you must buy the shares from them at the strike price.

<br>-Just because an option is in the money, doesn't mean it is profitable to exercise. You need to account for the trading fees as well.



<br><h3>Exercise Options</h3><div>When are options exercised?
<br>-Our platform lets you trade American style Options, so you can exercise Option contracts before the expiration date.
<br>-You would only want to exercise an option if it's in-the-money, 
otherwise you would lose money. If your call option contract is 
out-of-the-money, you can buy the underlying shares cheaper in the stock
 market than you would buy them for if you exercised the option.
