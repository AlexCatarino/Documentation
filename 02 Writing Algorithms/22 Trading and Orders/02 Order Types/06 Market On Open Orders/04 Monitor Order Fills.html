<p>Market on open orders fill at the opening auction. To monitor the fills of your order, save a reference to the <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/trading-and-orders/order-management/order-tickets">order ticket</a>.</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="csharp">// Buy 10 shares of SPY at the market open
var ticket = MarketOnOpenOrder("SPY", 10);
Debug($"Quantity filled: {ticket.QuantityFilled}; Fill price: {ticket.AverageFillPrice}");</pre>
<pre class="python"># Buy 10 shares of SPY at the market open
ticket = self.MarketOnOpenOrder("SPY", 10)
self.Debug(f"Quantity filled: {ticket.QuantityFilled}; Fill price: {ticket.AverageFillPrice}")</pre>
</div>

- You won't know the order fill price until after the order is completed. If your order quantity is too close to your total portfolio buying power, you have a high chance of it being rejected as there may be large changes in price overnight. Consider this when sizing your portfolio to increase your probability of successful trades.
<br>- Not guaranteed to fill if the auction is heavily skewed to one side of the order book
