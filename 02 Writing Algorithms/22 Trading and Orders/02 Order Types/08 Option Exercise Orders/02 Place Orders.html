<div>When are options exercised?
<br>-Our platform lets you trade American style Options, so you can exercise Option contracts before the expiration date.
<br>-You would only want to exercise an option if it's in-the-money, 
otherwise you would lose money. If your call option contract is 
out-of-the-money, you can buy the underlying shares cheaper in the stock
 market than you would buy them for if you exercised the option.


</div><div><br></div><div>How do I exercise an Option?
</div>-


<p>
To exercise an Option, call the ExerciseOption method with the Option contract Symbol and a quantity. If you do not have sufficient capital for the order, it is rejected. By default, Option exercise orders are synchronous and fill immediately.
</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="csharp">var ticket = ExerciseOption(contractSymbol, quantity);</pre>
<pre class="python">ticket = self.ExerciseOption(contract_symbol, quantity)</pre>
</div>

<p>You can provide a tag and <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/trading-and-orders/order-properties">order properties</a> to the <code>ExerciseOption</code> method.</p>
<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="csharp">ExerciseOption(symbol, quantity, tag: tag, orderProperties: orderProperties);</pre>
<pre class="python">self.ExerciseOption(symbol, quantity, tag=tag, orderProperties=order_properties)</pre>
</div>
