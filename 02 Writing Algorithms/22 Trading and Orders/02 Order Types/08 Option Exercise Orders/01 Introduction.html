<p>After you buy an Option contract, you can exercise your right to buy or sell the underlying shares at the strike price. After you sell an Option contract, if the buyer exercises their right to buy or sell the underlying shares, you must trade with them at the strike price. If you buy an Option, you don't need to exercise it. Instead, you can sell it or let it expire worthless if it's out of the money. If you hold a long position in an Option that expires in the money, LEAN automatically exercises it at the expiration date.</p>
