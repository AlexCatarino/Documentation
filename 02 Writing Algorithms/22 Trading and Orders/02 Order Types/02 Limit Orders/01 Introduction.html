<p>Limit orders are instructions to trade a number of units of an asset at a specific price or a better price. In contrast to market orders, limit orders have a set price they must fill at or better. A <span class="new-term">marketable limit order</span> has a limit price that crosses the spread. An <span class="new-term">unmarketable limit order</span> has a limit price that doesn't cross the spread. For example, if an asset has an ask price of $100 and you place a limit order to buy at $100 or higher, that's a marketable limit order that should immediately fill. If you place a limit order to buy at $99.99 or lower, that's an unmarketable limit order that should go on the order book.<br></p>Why use limit orders:
<br>-In contrast to market orders, limit orders have a set price that they must fill at (or better). If you place a marketable limit order (on that crosses the spread) instead of a market order, you know ahead of time what the worst fill price is you can receive (even though your order may not fill completely).
<br>-They are helpful in this case for illiquid markets
<br><div>-If you place an unmarketable limit order, it saves you from paying the spread costs.

Some brokerages may charge you a lower transaction fee as well (Maker fee instead of the Taker fee)</div><div>-Limit orders are often used to get a good entry price, or take-profit on an existing holding. 
</div><br>
Why not use limit orders:
<br>-If the market trades away from your limit price, you may have to wait for the market to trade back to your limit order to get filled, or you may have to adjust your limit order. If you place an unmarketable limit order (one that doesn't cross the spread), there is a chance that you end up filling at a worse price than if you were to just use a market order initially.
