<p>One cancels the other (OCO) orders are a set of orders that when one fills, it cancels the rest of the orders in the set. An example is to set a take-profit and a stop-loss order right after you enter a position. In this example, when either the take-profit or stop-loss order fills, you cancel the other order. OCO orders usually create an upper and lower bound on the exit price of a trade. </p>

<p>When you place OCO orders, their price levels are usually relative to the fill price of an entry trade. If your entry trade is a synchronous market order, you can immediately get the fill price from the order ticket. If your entry trade doesn't execute immediately, you can get the fill price in the <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/trading-and-orders/order-events#04-Track-Order-Events">OnOrderEvents</a> event handler.</p>

// Get the fill price from the OnOrderEvent event handler</pre>
<pre class="python"># Get the fill price from the order ticket of a sync market order

# Get the fill price from the OnOrderEvent event handler</pre>
</div>

<p>After you have the target price levels, to implement the OCO orders, you can place active orders or track the security price to simulate them.</p>

<h4>Place Active Orders</h4>

<p>If you set active OCO orders, the orders need to have price levels that are far enough apart from eachother so that multiple orders aren't triggered in a single time step.</p>

To place OCO orders, An alternative is to set the OCO orders in the OnOrderEvent handler when the entry order is filled ()

<h4>Simulate Orders</h4>
<p>The benefit of manually simulating the OCO orders is that both the OCO orders can't fill in the same time step.</p>

To manually simulate the OCO orders, save the OCO order prices using the fill price of the entry order. (starting point: )
