<p>
Market orders are synchronous by default. This means they wait for the order to fill before moving to the next line of code. If you are trading on highly illiquid stocks, this wait can be too long, so LEAN has a built-in default timeout of 5 seconds, after which the code execution will continue even if the trade is not filled. You can control this timeout with the <code>Transactions.MarketOrderFillTimeout</code> property.

<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="csharp">// Adjust the market fill-timeout to 30 seconds.
Transactions.MarketOrderFillTimeout = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(30);
</pre>
<pre class="python"> # Adjust the market fill-timeout to 30 seconds.
self.Transactions.MarketOrderFillTimeout = timedelta(seconds=30)
</pre>
