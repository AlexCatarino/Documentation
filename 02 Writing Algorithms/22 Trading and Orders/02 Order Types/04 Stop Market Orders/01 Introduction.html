<p>Stop market orders fill as a market order when the asset reaches a specific price. A buy stop market order triggers when the asset price is greater than or equal to the stop price. A sell stop market order triggers when the asset price is less than or equal to the stop price. You can use a stop market order to mitigate the risk of a large loss. However, if the market gaps past your stop price, the order may fill at a worse price than the stop price you entered. There is no guarantee that a stop market order fills at the stop price.</p>
