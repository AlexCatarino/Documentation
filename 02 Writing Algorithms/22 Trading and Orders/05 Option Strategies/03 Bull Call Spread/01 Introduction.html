<h4>Explanation</h4>
<p><b>Bull call spread</b>, which is also known as <b>long call spread</b>, consists of one long call with a lower strike price and one short call with a higher strike price. Both calls have the same underlying stock and the same expiration date. The higher-strike longed call serve as a hedge of the lower-strike shorted call.</p>
<p>It is a option strategy profitting from a rise in underlying asset price. This is a limited-reward-limited-risk strategy.</p>

<h4>Maximum Profit</h4>
<p>The maximum profit is the spread between the 2 options' strike prices minus net debit paid when opening the trade after commission. If the price is increased to exceed both strikes, both calls will will worth $(underlying price - strike) at expiration.</p>

<h4>Potential Risk</h4>
<p>Maximum loss is the net debit paid after commission when opening the trade, where is underlying price is below both strike prices and the options become worthless.</p>
<p>If the option is American option, there will be a risk of early assignment on the shorted option.</p>
