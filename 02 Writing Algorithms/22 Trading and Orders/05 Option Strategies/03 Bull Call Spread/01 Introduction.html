<p><span class="new-term">Bull call spread</span>, which is also known as <span class="new-term">long call spread</span>, consists of buying an ITM call and selling an OTM call. Both calls have the same underlying stock and the same expiration date. The OTM call serves as a hedge of the ITM call.</p>
<p>It is a option strategy profitting from a rise in underlying asset price. This is a limited-reward-limited-risk strategy.</p>

<p>The maximum profit is the spread between the 2 options' strike prices minus net debit paid when opening the trade after commission. If the price is increased to exceed both strikes, both calls will worth <span class="latex-variable">$(underlying price - strike)</span> at expiration.</p>
<p>Maximum loss is the net debit paid after commission when opening the trade, where is underlying price is below both strike prices and the options become worthless.</p>
<p>If the option is American option, there will be a risk of early assignment on the shorted option.</p>
