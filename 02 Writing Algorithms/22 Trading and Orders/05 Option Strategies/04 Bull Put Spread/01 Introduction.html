<h4>Explanation</h4>
<p><b>Bull put spread</b>, which is also known as <b>long put spread</b>, consists of one long put with a lower strike price and one short put with a higher strike price. Both puts have the same underlying stock and the same expiration date. The lower-strike longed put serve as a hedge of the higher-strike shorted put.</p>
<p>It is a option strategy profitting from a rise in underlying asset price. This is a limited-reward-limited-risk strategy.</p>

<h4>Maximum Profit</h4>
<p>The maximum profit is the net credit received after commission when opening the trade. If the price rised and higher than the higher strike price of the shorted put, both puts become worthless.</p>

<h4>Potential Risk</h4>
<p>Maximum loss is the spread between the 2 options' strike prices minus net credit received when opening the trade, where is underlying price is below both strike prices and the options being exercised/assigned.</p>
<p>If the option is American option, there will be a risk of early assignment on the shorted option.</p>
