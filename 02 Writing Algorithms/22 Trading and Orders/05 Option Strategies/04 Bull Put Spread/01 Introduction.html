<p><span class="new-term">Bull put spread</span>, which is also known as <span class="new-term">long put spread</span>, consists of buying an OTM put and selling an ITM put. Both puts have the same underlying stock and the same expiration date. The OTM put serve as a hedge of the ITM put.</p>
<p>It is a option strategy profitting from a rise in underlying asset price. This is a limited-reward-limited-risk strategy.</p>

$Payout_{OTM\ put}=(Strike_{OTM\ put}-Price_{underlying})^{+}$

$Payout_{ITM\ put}=(Strike_{ITM\ put}-Price_{underlying})^{+}$
<br><br>
$Profit/Loss=(Payout_{OTM\ put}-Payout_{ITM\ put}+credit\ received_{ITM\ put}-debit\ paid_{OTM\ put})\times multiplier-commissions$

<p>The maximum profit is the net credit received after commission when opening the trade. If the price rised and higher than the strike prices of both puts, both puts become worthless.</p>
<p>Maximum loss is the spread between the 2 options' strike prices minus net credit received when opening the trade, where the underlying price is below both strike prices and the options being exercised/assigned at expiration.</p>
<p>If the option is American option, there will be a risk of early assignment on the shorted option.</p>
