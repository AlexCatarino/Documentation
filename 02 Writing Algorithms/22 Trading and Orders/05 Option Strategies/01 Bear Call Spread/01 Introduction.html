<p><span class="new-term">Bear call spread</span>, which is also known as <span class="new-term">short call spread</span>, consists of buying an OTM call and selling an ITM call. Both calls have the same underlying stock and the same expiration date. The OTM call serves as a hedge of the ITM call.</p>
<p>It is a option strategy profitting from a decline in underlying asset price, as well as the time decay value of the shorted option contract. This is a limited-reward-limited-risk strategy.</p>

<p>The maximum profit is the net credit received after commission when opening the trade. If the price is declining, both calls will become worthless at expiration.</p>
<p>Maximum loss is the spread between the 2 options' strike prices minus net credit received when opening the trade, where is underlying price is above both strike prices and the options being exercised/assigned.</p>
<p>If the option is American option, there will be a risk of early assignment on the shorted option.</p>
