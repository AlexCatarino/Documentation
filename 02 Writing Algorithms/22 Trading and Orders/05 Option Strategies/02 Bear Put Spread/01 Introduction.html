<h4>Explanation</h4>
<p><b>Bear put spread</b>, which is also known as <b>short put spread</b>, consists of one short put with a lower strike price and one long put with a higher strike price. Both puts have the same underlying stock and the same expiration date. The lower-strike longed put serve as a hedge of the higher-strike shorted put.</p>
<p>It is a option strategy profitting from a decline in underlying asset price. This is a limited-reward-limited-risk strategy.</p>

<h4>Maximum Profit</h4>
<p>The maximum profit is the spread between the 2 options' strike prices minus net debit paid when opening the trade. If the price is declined and lower than the lower strike price of the longed put, both puts will worth $(strike - underlying price) at expiration.</p>

<h4>Potential Risk</h4>
<p>Maximum loss is the net debit paid after commission when opening the trade, where is underlying price is above both strike prices and the options become worthless.</p>
<p>If the option is American option, there will be a risk of early assignment on the shorted option.</p>
