<p>If you didn't save a reference to your order ticket when you created an order, you can call the GetOrderTicket method to get the ticket. You need to pass the order ID to the method. If you don't have the order ID, you can use the LastOrderID property to get the order ID of the most recent order.</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="csharp">var orderId = TransactionManager.LastOrderID;
var ticket = TransactionManager.GetOrderTicket(orderId);</pre>
<pre class="python">order_id = self.TransactionManager.LastOrderID
ticket = TransactionManager.GetOrderTicket(order_id)</pre>
</div>
