<p>The maximum profit is the net credit received after commission when opening the trade. If the price rised and higher than the strike prices of both puts, both puts become worthless.</p>
<p>Maximum loss is the spread between the 2 options' strike prices minus net credit received when opening the trade, where the underlying price is below both strike prices and the options being exercised/assigned at expiration.</p>
<p>If the option is American option, there will be a risk of early assignment on the shorted option.</p>
