<p><span class="new-term">Call butterfly</span> is the combination of a bull call spread and a bear call spread. All calls have the same underlying stock and the same expiration date, and the distance of ITM-ATM and OTM-ATM call pairs are the same.</p>
<h4>Long Call Butterfly</h4>
<p>It consists of buying an ITM call & an OTM call, while selling 2 ATM calls. It is a option strategy profitting from a low volatility. This is a limited-reward-limited-risk strategy.</p>

<p>The maximum profit is the range of 1 strike spread (ATM strike - ITM strike) minus net debit paid when opening the trade after commission, if the underlying price is staying the same as the trade opened at expiration, where combined bull and bear call spreads' payouts at its maximum.</p>
<p>Maximum loss is the net debit paid after commission when opening the trade, where the underlying price is less than ITM strike or greater than OTM strike.</p>
<p>If the option is American option, there will be a risk of early assignment on the shorted option.</p>

<h4>Short Call Butterfly</h4>
<p>It consists of selling an ITM call & an OTM call, while buying 2 ATM calls. It is a option strategy profitting from a drastic change in underlying price. This is a limited-reward-limited-risk strategy.</p>
$Profit/Loss=(2\times Payout_{ATM\ call}-Payout_{ITM\ call}-Payout_{OTM\ call}-2\times debit\ paid_{ATM\ call}-credit\ received_{ITM\ call}-credit\ received_{OTM\ call})\times multiplier-commissions$

<p>The maximum profit is the net credit received after commission when opening the trade, if the underlying price less than ITM strike or greater than OTM strike at expiration.</p>
<p>Maximum loss is the range of 1 strike spread (ATM strike - ITM strike) minus net credit received when opening the trade after commission, where the underlying price is at the same level when the trade opened.</p>
<p>If the option is American option, there will be a risk of early assignment on the shorted option.</p>
