What is a put calendar spread:
<br>-Sell X put options with strike S and expiration E_1. Buy X put options with strike S and expiration E_2 > E_1.
<br>-The strike should be as close to the underlying price as possible
<br>-AKA inter-delivery, intra-market, time spread, or horizontal spreads
<br>-The further the strike S is out of the money when you enter the trade, the more bearish you're on the underlying.

<br><br>What is the max profit/loss:
<br>Max profit: Max profit from the longer-term put option and the shorter-term put expires worthless
<br>-Max loss: The amount paid to open the strategy
<br>-If the underlying is below the strike S at E_1, you can exercise the longer-term put to cover the shares of the assignment from the shorter-term put.

<br><br>-Since you sell a put option, there is a risk of early assignment
