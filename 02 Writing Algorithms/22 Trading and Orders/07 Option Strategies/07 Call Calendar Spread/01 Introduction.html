<p><span class="new-term">Call calendar spread</span>, also known as <span class="new-term">call horizontal spread</span>, is a combination of a longer-term (far-leg/front-month) call and a shorter-term (near-leg/back-month) call, where all calls have the same underlying stock and the same strike price. The call calendar spread can be long or short.</p>
<h4>Long Call Calendar Spread</h4>
<p>The long call calendar spread consists of buying a longer-term call and selling a shorter-term call. This strategy profits from a decrease in the underlying price. It also profits from the time decay value because the theta $\theta$ (the Option price decay by 1 day closer to maturity) of the shorter-term call is larger than longer-term call.</p>

<h4>Short Call Calendar Spread</h4>
<p>The short call calendar spread consists of selling a longer-term call and buying a shorter-term call. The strategy profits from from an increase in the underlying price.</p>
