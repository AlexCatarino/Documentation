<p><span class="new-term">Bear put spread</span>, also known as <span class="new-term">short put spread</span>, consists of buying an ITM put and selling an OTM put. Both puts have the same underlying Equity and the same expiration date. The OTM put serves as a hedge for the ITM put. The bear put spread profits from a decline in underlying asset price.</p>
