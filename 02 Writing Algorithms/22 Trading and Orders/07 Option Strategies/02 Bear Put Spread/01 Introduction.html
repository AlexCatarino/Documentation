<p><span class="new-term">Bear put spread</span>, also known as <span class="new-term">short put spread</span>, consists of buying an ITM put and selling an OTM put. Both puts have the same underlying Equity and the same expiration date. The OTM put serves as a hedge for the ITM put. The bear put spread profits from a decline in underlying asset price.</p>
<p>The bear put spread is a limited-reward-limited-risk strategy. The payoff is</p>

<p>The maximum profit is $K^{ITM} - K^{OTM} + P^{OTM}_0 - P^{ITM}_0$. If the price is declined and lower than the strike prices of both puts, they will worth $(K - S_T)$ at expiration.</p>
<p>Maximum loss is the net debit paid: $P^{OTM}_0 - P^{ITM}_0$, where is underlying price is above both strike prices such that the Options become worthless.</p>
<p>If the Option is American Option, there will be a risk of early assignment on the shorted Option.</p>
