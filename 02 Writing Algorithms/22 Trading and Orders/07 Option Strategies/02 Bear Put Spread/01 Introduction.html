<p><span class="new-term">Bear put spread</span>, also known as <span class="new-term">short put spread</span>, consists of buying an ITM put and selling an OTM put. Both puts have the same underlying Equity and the same expiration date. The OTM put serves as a hedge for the ITM put. The bear put spread profits from a decline in underlying asset price.</p>
<p>The bear put spread is a limited-reward-limited-risk strategy. The payoff is</p>
$Payoff_{OTM\ put}=(Strike_{OTM\ put}-Price_{underlying})^{+}$
<br><br>
$Payoff_{ITM\ put}=(Strike_{ITM\ put}-Price_{underlying})^{+}$
<br><br>
$Profit/Loss=(Payoff_{ITM\ put}-Payoff_{OTM\ put}+credit\ received_{OTM\ put}-debit\ paid_{ITM\ put})\times multiplier-commissions$

<p>The maximum profit is the spread between the strike prices of the 2 contracts minus the net debit paid when opening the trade. If the underlying price is lower than both strike prices, the contracts expire worth <span class="latex-variable">$(strike - underlying price)</span>.</p>
<p>The maximum loss is the net debit paid after commission when opening the trade, where is underlying price is above both strike prices and the options become worthless.</p>
<p>If the Option is American Option, there is a risk of early assignment on the sold contract.</p>
