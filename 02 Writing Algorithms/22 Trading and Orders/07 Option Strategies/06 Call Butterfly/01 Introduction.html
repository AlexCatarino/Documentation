<p>The <span class="new-term">call butterfly</span> strategy is the combination of a <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/trading-and-orders/option-strategies/bull-call-spread">bull call spread</a> and a <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/trading-and-orders/option-strategies/bear-call-spread">bear call spread</a>. In the call butterfly, all of the calls should have the same underlying Equity, the same expiration date, and the same strike price distance between the ITM-ATM and OTM-ATM call pairs. The call butterfly can be long or short.</p>
<h4>Long Call Butterfly</h4>
<p>The long call butterfly consists of a long ITM call, a long OTM call, and 2 short ATM calls. This strategy profits from low volatility in the underlying Equity price.&nbsp;</p><p>This is a limited-reward-limited-risk strategy. The payoff is</p>

<p>The following chart shows the payoff at expiration:</p>
<img class="docs-image" src="https://cdn.quantconnect.com/i/tu/long-call-butterfly.png">
<p>The maximum profit is $K^{ATM} - K^{ITM} + 2\times C^{ATM}_0 - C^{ITM}_0 - C^{OTM}_0$, if the underlying price is staying the same as the trade opened at expiration, where combined bull and bear call spreads' payouts at its maximum.</p>
<p>The maximum loss is the net debit paid: $2\times C^{ATM}_0 - C^{ITM}_0 - C^{OTM}_0$, where the underlying price is less than ITM strike or greater than OTM strike.</p>
<p>If the Option is an American Option, there is a risk of early assignment on the sold contracts.</p>

<h4>Short Call Butterfly</h4>
<p>The short call butterfly consists of a short ITM call, a short OTM call, and 2 long ATM calls. This strategy profits from high volatility in the underlying Equity price.</p>
<p>This is a limited-reward-limited-risk strategy. The payoff is</p>
$Profit/Loss=(2\times Payoff_{ATM\ call}-Payoff_{ITM\ call}-Payoff_{OTM\ call}-2\times debit\ paid_{ATM\ call}-credit\ received_{ITM\ call}-credit\ received_{OTM\ call})\times multiplier-commissions$
