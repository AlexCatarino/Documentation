<p>The <span class="new-term">call butterfly</span> strategy is the combination of a <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/trading-and-orders/option-strategies/bull-call-spread">bull call spread</a> and a <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/trading-and-orders/option-strategies/bear-call-spread">bear call spread</a>. In the call butterfly, all of the calls should have the same underlying Equity, the same expiration date, and the same strike price distance between the ITM-ATM and OTM-ATM call pairs. The call butterfly can be long or short.</p>
<h4>Long Call Butterfly</h4>
<p>The long call butterfly consists of a long ITM call, a long OTM call, and 2 short ATM calls. This strategy profits from low volatility in the underlying Equity price.&nbsp;</p><p>This is a limited-reward-limited-risk strategy. The payoff is</p>
$Payoff_{OTM\ call}$
$=(Price_{underlying}-Strike_{OTM\ call})^{+}$
<br><br>
$Payoff_{ITM\ call}$
$=(Price_{underlying}-Strike_{ITM\ call})^{+}$
<br><br>
$Payoff_{ATM\ call}=(Price_{underlying}-Strike_{ATM\ call})^{+}$
<br><br>
$Profit/Loss=(Payoff_{ITM\ call}+Payoff_{OTM\ call}-2\times Payoff_{ATM\ call}+2\times credit\ received_{ATM\ call}-debit\ paid_{ITM\ call}-debit\ paid_{OTM\ call})\times multiplier-commissions$
<br><br>

<p>The maximum profit is the range of 1 strike spread (ATM strike - ITM strike) minus the net debit paid when opening the trade after commission, if the underlying price is staying the same as the trade opened at expiration, where combined bull and bear call spreads' payouts at its maximum.</p>
<p>The maximum loss is the net debit paid after commission when opening the trade, where the underlying price is less than ITM strike or greater than OTM strike.</p>
<p>If the Option is an American Option, there is a risk of early assignment on the sold contracts.</p>

<h4>Short Call Butterfly</h4>
<p>The short call butterfly consists of a short ITM call, a short OTM call, and 2 long ATM calls. This strategy profits from high volatility in the underlying Equity price.</p>
<p>This is a limited-reward-limited-risk strategy. The payoff is</p>
$Profit/Loss=(2\times Payoff_{ATM\ call}-Payoff_{ITM\ call}-Payoff_{OTM\ call}-2\times debit\ paid_{ATM\ call}-credit\ received_{ITM\ call}-credit\ received_{OTM\ call})\times multiplier-commissions$
<br><br>
<img class="docs-image" src="https://cdn.quantconnect.com/i/tu/short-call-butterfly.png">

<p>The maximum profit is the net credit received after commission when opening the trade, if the underlying price less than ITM strike or greater than OTM strike at expiration.</p>
<p>The maximum loss is the range of 1 strike spread (ATM strike - ITM strike) minus net credit received when opening the trade after commission, where the underlying price is at the same level when the trade opened.</p>
<p>If the Option is an American Option, there is a risk of early assignment on the sold contracts.<br></p>
