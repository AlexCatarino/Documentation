<p>The iron condor can be long or short.</p>

<h4>Long Iron Condor</h4>
<p>The long iron condor is a limited-reward-limited-risk strategy. The payoff is</p>
$Payoff_{far\ OTM\ call}=(Price_{underlying}-Strike_{far\ OTM\ call})^{+}$
<br><br>
$Payoff_{near\ OTM\ call}=(Price_{underlying}-Strike_{near\ OTM\ call})^{+}$
<br><br>
$Payoff_{far\ OTM\ put}=(Strike_{far\ OTM\ put}-Price_{underlying})^{+}$
<br><br>
$Payoff_{near\ OTM\ put}=(Strike_{near\ OTM\ put}-Price_{underlying})^{+}$
<br><br>
$$Profit/Loss=(Payoff_{near\ OTM\ call}+Payoff_{near\ OTM\ put}-Payoff_{far\ OTM\ call}-Payoff_{far\ OTM\ put}\\
\quad+credit\ received_{far\ OTM\ call}+credit\ received_{far\ OTM\ put}-debit\ paid_{near\ OTM\ call}-debit\ paid_{near\ OTM\ put})\\
\quad\times multiplier-commissions$$
<br><br>

<p>The maximum profit is $Strike_{far\ OTM\ call}-Strike_{near\ OTM\ call}$ minus net debit paid when opening the trade, where the underlying price fell below the OTM put strike or above the OTM call strike price at expiration.</p>
<p>The maximum loss is the net debit paid after commission when opening the trade, where $Strike_{near\ OTM\ put} &lt; underlying price &lt; Strike_{near\ OTM\ call}$.</p>
<p>If the Option is American Option, there is a risk of early assignment on the sold contracts.</p>

<h4>Short Iron Condor</h4>
<p>The short iron condor is a limited-reward-limited-risk strategy. The payoff is</p>
$$Profit/Loss=(Payoff_{OTM\ call}+Payoff_{OTM\ put}-Payoff_{ATM\ call}-Payoff_{ATM\ put}\\
\quad+credit\ received_{ATM\ call}+credit\ received_{ATM\ put}-debit\ paid_{OTM\ call}-debit\ paid_{OTM\ put})\\
\quad\times multiplier-commissions$$
<br><br>

<img class="docs-image" src="https://cdn.quantconnect.com/i/tu/short-iron-condor.png">

<p>The maximum profit is the net credit received after commission when opening the trade, where $Strike_{near\ OTM\ put} &lt; underlying price &lt; Strike_{near\ OTM\ call}$.</p>
<p>The maximum loss is $Strike_{far\ OTM\ call}-Strike_{near\ OTM\ call}$ minus net credit received when opening the trade, where the underlying price fell below the OTM put strike or above the OTM call strike price at expiration.</p>
<p>If the Option is American Option, there is risk of early assignment on the sold contracts.</p>
