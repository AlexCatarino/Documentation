<p>The iron condor can be long or short.</p>

<h4>Long Iron Condor</h4>
<p>The long iron condor consists of selling an OTM call, selling an OTM put, buying an ATM call, and buying an ATM put. This strategy profits from a decrease in price movement (implied volatility).</p>
<p>This is a limited-reward-limited-risk strategy. The payoff is</p>
$Payoff_{far\ OTM\ call}=(Price_{underlying}-Strike_{far\ OTM\ call})^{+}$
<br><br>
$Payoff_{near\ OTM\ call}=(Price_{underlying}-Strike_{near\ OTM\ call})^{+}$
<br><br>
$Payoff_{far\ OTM\ put}=(Strike_{far\ OTM\ put}-Price_{underlying})^{+}$
<br><br>
$Payoff_{near\ OTM\ put}=(Strike_{near\ OTM\ put}-Price_{underlying})^{+}$
<br><br>
$$Profit/Loss=(Payoff_{near\ OTM\ call}+Payoff_{near\ OTM\ put}-Payoff_{far\ OTM\ call}-Payoff_{far\ OTM\ put}\\
\quad+credit\ received_{far\ OTM\ call}+credit\ received_{far\ OTM\ put}-debit\ paid_{near\ OTM\ call}-debit\ paid_{near\ OTM\ put})\\
\quad\times multiplier-commissions$$
<br><br>

<p>The maximum profit is $Strike_{far\ OTM\ call}-Strike_{near\ OTM\ call}$ minus net debit paid when opening the trade, where the underlying price fell below the OTM put strike or above the OTM call strike price at expiration.</p>
<p>The maximum loss is the net debit paid after commission when opening the trade, where $Strike_{near\ OTM\ put} &lt; underlying price &lt; Strike_{near\ OTM\ call}$.</p>
<p>If the Option is American Option, there is a risk of early assignment on the sold contracts.</p>

<h4>Short Iron Condor</h4>
<p>The short iron condor consists of buying an OTM call, buying an OTM put, selling an ATM call, and selling an ATM put. This strategy profits from an increase in price movement (implied volatility) and time decay since ATM options decay sharper.</p>
<p>This is a limited-reward-limited-risk strategy. The payoff is</p>
$$Profit/Loss=(Payoff_{OTM\ call}+Payoff_{OTM\ put}-Payoff_{ATM\ call}-Payoff_{ATM\ put}\\
\quad+credit\ received_{ATM\ call}+credit\ received_{ATM\ put}-debit\ paid_{OTM\ call}-debit\ paid_{OTM\ put})\\
\quad\times multiplier-commissions$$
