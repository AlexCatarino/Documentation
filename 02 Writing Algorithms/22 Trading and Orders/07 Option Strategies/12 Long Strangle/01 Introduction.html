<p><span class="new-term">Long Strangle</span> is an Options trading strategy that consists of simultaneous buying of an OTM put and an OTM call, where both contracts have the same underlying asset and expiration date. This strategy aims to profit from volatile movements in the underlying stock, either positive or negative.</p>
<p>Compared to a long straddle, the net debit of a long strangle is lower since OTM Options are cheaper. Additionally, the losing range of a long straddle is wider and the strike spread is wider.</p>
<p>The payoff of this strategy is</p>
$Payoff_{call}=(Price_{underlying}-Strike)^{+}$
<br><br>
$Payoff_{put}=(Strike-Price_{underlying})^{+}$
<br><br>
$Profit/Loss=(Payoff_{call}+Payoff_{put}-debit\ paid_{call}-debit\ paid_{put})\times multiplier-commissions$
<br><br>

<p>The maximum profit is unlimited, if the underlying price is risen to infinity at expiration.</p>
<p>The maximum loss is the net debit paid when opening the trade, where is underlying price is unchanged and both options become worthless.</p>
