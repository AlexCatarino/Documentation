<p><span class="new-term">Bull put spread</span>, also known as <span class="new-term">long put spread</span>, consists of buying an OTM put and selling an ITM put. Both puts have the same underlying Equity and the same expiration date. The OTM put serve as a hedge for the ITM put. The bull put spread profits from a rise in underlying asset price.</p>
<p>This is a limited-reward-limited-risk strategy. The payoff is</p>

P^{ITM}_T & = & (K^{ITM} - S_T)^{+}\\

<p>The following chart shows the payoff at expiration:</p>

<p>The maximum profit is the net credit received: $P^{ITM}_0 - P^{OTM}_0$. If the price rised to higher than the strike prices of both puts, both puts become worthless.</p>
<p>Maximum loss is $K^{ITM} - K^{OTM} + P^{ITM}_0 - P^{OTM}_0$, where the underlying price is below both strike prices.</p>
<p>If the Option is American Option, there will be a risk of early assignment on the shorted Option.</p>
