<p>The following chart shows the payoff at expiration:</p>
<img class="docs-image" src="https://cdn.quantconnect.com/tutorials/i/Tutorial08-protective-collar.png" alt="protective collar strategy payoff">

<p>The maximum profit is $K^{C} - S_T + C_0 - P_0$, where the underlying price has price the same as or above the strike price of the call at expiration.</p>
<p>The maximum profit is $S_T - K^{P} + C_0 - P_0$, where the underlying price has price the same as or below the strike price of the put at expiration.</p>
<p>If the Option is American Option, there is risk of early assignment on the sold contract.</p>
