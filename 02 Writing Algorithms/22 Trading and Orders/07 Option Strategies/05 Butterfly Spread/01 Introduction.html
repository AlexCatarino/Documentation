<tbody>
<tr>
<td> Long butterfly spread with calls</td>
<td> Buy 1 ITM call, sell 2 ATM call, buy 1 OTM call</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Long butterfly spread with puts</td>
<td> Buy 1 ITM put, sell 2 ATM put, buy 1 OTM put</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Short butterfly spread with calls</td>
<td> Sell 1 ITM call, buy 2 ATM call, sell 1 OTM call</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Short butterfly spread with puts</td>
<td> Buy 1 ITM put, sell 2 ATM put, buy 1 OTM put</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
