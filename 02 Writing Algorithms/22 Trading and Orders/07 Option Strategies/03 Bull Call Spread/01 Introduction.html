<p><span class="new-term">Bull call spread</span>, also known as <span class="new-term">long call spread</span>, consists of buying an ITM call and selling an OTM call. Both calls have the same underlying Equity and the same expiration date. The OTM call serves as a hedge for the ITM call. The bull call spread profits from a rise in underlying asset price.</p>
