<p><span class="new-term">Bull call spread</span>, also known as <span class="new-term">long call spread</span>, consists of buying an ITM call and selling an OTM call. Both calls have the same underlying Equity and the same expiration date. The OTM call serves as a hedge for the ITM call. The bull call spread profits from a rise in underlying asset price.</p>
<p>The bull call spread is a limited-reward-limited-risk strategy. The payoff is</p>
$Payoff_{OTM\ call}=(Price_{underlying}-Strike_{OTM\ call})^{+}$
<br><br>
$Payoff_{ITM\ call}=(Price_{underlying}-Strike_{ITM\ call})^{+}$
<br><br>
$Profit/Loss=(Payoff_{ITM\ call}-Payoff_{OTM\ call}+credit\ received_{OTM\ call}-debit\ paid_{ITM\ call})\times multiplier-commissions$

<p>The maximum profit is the spread between the strike prices of the 2 contracts minus net debit paid when opening the trade after commission. If the underlying price increases to exceed both strikes at expiration, both calls are worth <span class="latex-variable">$(underlying price - strike)</span>.</p>
<p>The maximum loss is the net debit paid after commission when opening the trade, where is underlying price is below both strike prices and the options become worthless.</p>
<p>If the Option is an American Option, there is a risk of early assignment on the sold contract.</p>
