<p><span class="new-term">Bear call spread</span>, also known as <span class="new-term">short call spread</span>, consists of selling an ITM call and buying an OTM call. Both calls have the same underlying Equity and the same expiration date. The ITM call serves as a hedge for the OTM call. The bear call spread profits from a drop in underlying asset price.</p>
<p>The bear call spread is a limited-reward-limited-risk strategy. The payoff is</p>

<p>The following chart shows the payoff at expiration:</p>

<p>The maximum profit is the net credit received: $C^{ITM}_0 - C^{OTM}_0$. If the price is declining, both calls will become worthless at expiration.</p>
<p>Maximum loss is $K^{OTM} - K^{ITM} + C^{ITM}_0 - C^{OTM}_0$, where is underlying price is above both strike prices.</p>
<p>If the Option is American Option, there will be a risk of early assignment on the shorted Option.</p>
