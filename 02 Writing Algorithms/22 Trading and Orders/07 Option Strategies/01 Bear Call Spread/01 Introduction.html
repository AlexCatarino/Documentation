<p><span class="new-term">Bear call spread</span>, also known as <span class="new-term">short call spread</span>, consists of buying an OTM call and selling an ITM call. Both calls have the same underlying Equity and the same expiration date. The OTM call serves as a hedge for the ITM call. The bear call spread profits from a decline in underlying asset price&nbsp;and the time decay value of the ITM call.</p>
<p>The bear call spread is a limited-reward-limited-risk strategy. The payoff is</p>
$Payoff_{OTM\ call}=(Price_{underlying}-Strike_{OTM\ call})^{+}$
<br><br>
$Payoff_{ITM\ call}=(Price_{underlying}-Strike_{ITM\ call})^{+}$
<br><br>
$Profit/Loss=(Payoff_{OTM\ call}-Payoff_{ITM\ call}+credit\ received_{ITM\ call}-debit\ paid_{OTM\ call})\times multiplier-commissions$
<br><br>

<p>The following chart shows the payoff at expiration:</p>

<p>The maximum profit is the net credit received after commission when opening the trade. If the price declines, both calls expire worthless.</p>
<p>The maximum loss is the spread between the strike prices of the 2 contracts minus the net credit received when opening the trade, where is underlying price is above both strike prices and the options being exercised/assigned.</p>
<p>If the Option is an American Option, there is a risk of early assignment on the sold contract.</p>
