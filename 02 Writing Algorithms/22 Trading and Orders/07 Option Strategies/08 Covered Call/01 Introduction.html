A <span class="new-term">Covered Call</span>&nbsp;consists of buying a stock and selling call Options for the same amount of stock. The aim of the Covered Call is to profits from the option premium by selling calls written on the stock you already owned. At any time for US Options or at expiration for European Options, if the stock moves below the strike price, you can keep the premium and still maintain the stock position. If the price moves above the strike, the Options contract will be exercised and you will have to sell the stock at the strike price, but you will still keep the premium. The risk of a Covered Call also comes from the long stock position, whose price could drop.

<p>
The payoff is as follows:
</p>
$Payoff_{call}=(Price_{underlying}-Strike_{call})^{+}$
<br><br>
$Payoff=(Price^{T=expiry}_{underlying}-Price^{T=trade\ open}_{underlying}+credit\ received_{call}-Payoff_{call})\times multiplier-commissions$
<br><br>

<p>The maximum profit is the call strike minus underlying price plus the premium of selling the call after commission when opening the trade, where the underlying price has price the same as or above the strike price of the call at expiration.</p>
<p>If the underlying price drop, the maximum loss is unlimited, but it will always be offset by the premium of selling the call after commission when opening the trade.</p>
<p>If the Option is American Option, there is risk of early assignment on the sold contract. Naked long calls pose a risk of losing all the debit paid if you don't close its position with shorted call together and the price dropped below its strike.</p>
