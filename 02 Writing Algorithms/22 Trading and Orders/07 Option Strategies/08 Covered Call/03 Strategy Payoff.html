<p>The following chart shows the payoff at expiration:</p>
<img class="docs-image" src="https://cdn.quantconnect.com/tutorials/i/Tutorial01-covered-call.png" alt="covered call strategy payoff">
<p>The maximum profit is $K - S_T + C_0$, where the underlying price has price the same as or above the strike price of the call at expiration.</p>
<p>If the underlying price drop, the maximum loss is unlimited, but it will always be offset by $C_0$.</p>
<p>If the Option is American Option, there is risk of early assignment on the sold contract. Naked long calls pose a risk of losing all the debit paid if you don't close its position with shorted call together and the price dropped below its strike.</p>
