<p>The payoff of the strategy is</p>
$Payoff_{call}=(Price_{underlying}-Strike_{call})^{+}$

$Payoff=(Price^{T=expiry}_{underlying}-Price^{T=trade\ open}_{underlying}+credit\ received_{call}-Payoff_{call})\times multiplier-commissions$

<p>The maximum profit is the call strike minus underlying price plus the premium of selling the call after commission when opening the trade, where the underlying price has price the same as or above the strike price of the call at expiration.</p>
<p>If the underlying price drop, the maximum loss is unlimited, but it will always be offset by the premium of selling the call after commission when opening the trade.</p>
<p>If the Option is American Option, there is risk of early assignment on the sold contract. Naked long calls pose a risk of losing all the debit paid if you don't close its position with shorted call together and the price dropped below its strike.</p>
