<p>The iron butterfly can be long or short.</p>
<h4>Long Iron Butterfly</h4>
<p>The long iron butterfly is a limited-reward-limited-risk strategy. The payoff is as follows:</p>
$Payoff_{OTM\ call}=(Price_{underlying}-Strike_{OTM\ call})^{+}$
<br><br>
$Payoff_{ATM\ call}=(Price_{underlying}-Strike_{ATM\ call})^{+}$
<br><br>
$Payoff_{ATM\ put}=(Strike_{ATM\ put}-Price_{underlying})^{+}$
<br><br>
$Payoff_{OTM\ put}=(Strike_{OTM\ put}-Price_{underlying})^{+}$
<br><br>
$$Profit/Loss=(Payoff_{ATM\ call}+Payoff_{ATM\ put}-Payoff_{OTM\ call}-Payoff_{OTM\ put}\\
\quad+credit\ received_{OTM\ call}+credit\ received_{OTM\ put}-debit\ paid_{ATM\ call}-debit\ paid_{ATM\ put})\\
\quad\times multiplier-commissions$$
<br><br>

<p>The maximum profit is $Strike_{OTM\ call}-Strike_{ATM\ call}$ minus net debit paid when opening the trade, where the underlying price fell below the OTM put strike or above the OTM call strike price at expiration.</p>
<p>Maximum loss is the net debit paid after commission when opening the trade, where the underlying price stays the same as the trade opens.</p>
<p>If the option is American option, there will be a risk of early assignment on the shorted option.</p>

<h4>Short Call Butterfly</h4>
<p>The short call butterfly is a limited-reward-limited-risk strategy. The payoff is as follows:</p>
$$Profit/Loss=(Payoff_{OTM\ call}+Payoff_{OTM\ put}-Payoff_{ATM\ call}-Payoff_{ATM\ put}\\
\quad+credit\ received_{ATM\ call}+credit\ received_{ATM\ put}-debit\ paid_{OTM\ call}-debit\ paid_{OTM\ put})\\
\quad\times multiplier-commissions$$
<br><br>

<p>The maximum profit is the net credit received after commission when opening the trade, where the underlying price stays the same as the trade opens.</p>
<p>Maximum loss is $Strike_{OTM\ call}-Strike_{ATM\ call}$ minus net credit received when opening the trade, where the underlying price fell below the OTM put strike or above the OTM call strike price at expiration.</p>
