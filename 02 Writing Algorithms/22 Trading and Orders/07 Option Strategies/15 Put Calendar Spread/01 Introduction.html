<p><span class="new-term">Put calendar spread</span>, also known as <span class="new-term">put horizontal spread</span>, is a combination of a longer-term (far-leg/front-month) put and a shorter-term (near-leg/back-month) put, where both puts have the same underlying stock and the same strike price. The put calendar spread strategy can be long or short.</p>
<h4>Long Put Calendar Spread</h4>
<p>The long put calendar spread consists of buying a longer-term put and selling a shorter-term put. This strategy profits from a decrease in price movement. The strategy also profits from the time decay value because the theta $\theta$ (the Option price decay by 1 day closer to maturity) of the shorter-term put is larger than the longer-term put.</p>

<h4>Short Put Calendar Spread</h4>
<p>The short put calendar spread consists of selling a longer-term put and buying a shorter-term put. This strategy profits from an increase in price movement.</p>
