<p><span class="new-term">Put calendar spread</span>, also known as <span class="new-term">put horizontal spread</span>, is a combination of a longer-term (far-leg/front-month) put and a shorter-term (near-leg/back-month) put, where both puts have the same underlying stock and the same strike price. The put calendar spread strategy can be long or short.</p>
<h4>Long Put Calendar Spread</h4>
<p>The long put calendar spread consists of buying a longer-term put and selling a shorter-term put. This strategy profits from a decrease in price movement. The strategy also profits from the time decay value because the theta $\theta$ (the Option price decay by 1 day closer to maturity) of the shorter-term put is larger than the longer-term put.</p>
<p>This is a limited-reward-limited-risk strategy. The payoff is taken at the shorter-term expiration. The payoff is</p>
$Payoff_{shorter\ term\ put}=(Strike-Price_{underlying})^{+}$
<br><br>
$Profit/Loss^{t}=(Price^{t}_{longer\ term\ put}-Payoff_{shorter\ term\ put}+credit\ received_{shorter\ term\ put}-debit\ paid_{longer\ term\ put})\times multiplier-commissions$
<br><br>
<p>where $t$ is the expiration of shorter-term put</p>

<p>The maximum profit is undetermined as a dependent of volatility but limited, where the underlying price stays the same as the trade opened and the spread of the puts are at maximum.</p>
<p>The maximum loss is the net debit paid after commission when opening the trade, where the underlying price moves very deep ITM or OTM so the spread of both puts close to zero.</p>
<p>If the Option is American Option, there is risk of early assignment on the sold contract. Naked long puts pose risk of losing all the debit paid if you don't close the position with short put together and the price drops below its strike.</p>

<h4>Short Put Calendar Spread</h4>
<p>The short put calendar spread consists of selling a longer-term put and buying a shorter-term put. This strategy profits from an increase in price movement.</p>
<p>The payoff is taken at the shorter-term expiration. This is a limited-reward-limited-risk strategy. The payoff is</p>
$Profit/Loss^{t}=(Payoff_{shorter\ term\ put}-Price^{t}_{longer\ term\ put}+credit\ received_{longer\ term\ put}-debit\ paid_{shorter\ term\ put})\times multiplier-commissions$
<br><br>
<p>where $t$ is the expiration of shorter-term put</p>

<img class="docs-image" src="https://cdn.quantconnect.com/i/tu/short-put-calendar-spread.png">

<p>The maximum profit is the net credit received after commission when opening the trade, where the underlying price moves very deep ITM or OTM so the spread of both puts close to zero.</p>
<p>The maximum loss is undetermined as a dependent of volatility but limited, where the underlying price is at the same level when the trade opened and the spread of the 2 puts are at its maximum.</p>
<p>If the Option is American Option, there is risk of early assignment on the sold contract. Additionally, if you don't close the put positions together, the naked short put will have unlimited drawdown risk after the long put expires.</p>
