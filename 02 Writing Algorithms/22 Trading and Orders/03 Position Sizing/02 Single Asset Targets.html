The SetHoldings method automatically calculates the number of asset units to purchase according to the fraction of the portfolio value provided. This is a quick way to set up a portfolio with a set of weights for assets. If you already have holdings, you may want to liquidate the existing holdings first to free up buying power.
</p>
<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="csharp">// Allocate 50% of portfolio value to IBM via market orders
SetHoldings("IBM", 0.5);

// Allocate 50% of portfolio value to IBM, but liquidate other holdings before starting
SetHoldings("IBM", 0.5, true);

// The SetHoldings method can also accept a tag and order properties
SetHoldings(symbol, weight, liquidateHoldings, tag, orderProperties);
</pre>
<pre class="python"> # Allocate 50% of buying power to IBM via market orders.
self.SetHoldings("IBM", 0.5)

# Allocate 50% of portfolio value to IBM, but liquidate other holdings before starting
self.SetHoldings("IBM", 0.5, True)

# The SetHoldings method can also accept a tag and order properties
self.SetHoldings(symbol, weight, liquidate_holdings, tag, order_properties)</pre>
</div>

<p>If the percentage you provide translates to an order quantity of 0, the <code>SetHoldings</code> method doesn’t place an order and doesn’t log anything.</p>
