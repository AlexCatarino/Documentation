<p>
Often when trading on a weighted basket of assets, you must intelligently scale down existing positions before increasing allocations to other assets. The portfolio variant of SetHoldings was designed to do this operation for you by accepting an array of $[PortfolioTarget, T:QuantConnect.Algorithm.Framework.Portfolio.PortfolioTarget] objects. </p>

<p>
If you already have holdings, the LEAN engine will calculate the delta-order required to meet your new target. When required, positions will be scaled down before other positions are scaled up in size.
