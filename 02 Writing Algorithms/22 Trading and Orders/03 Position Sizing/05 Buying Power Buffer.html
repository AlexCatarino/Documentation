To ensure a high probability of order fills through market gaps and discontinuities the QuantConnect automatic portfolio methods assume a small built-in cash buffer. This buffer helps ensure you have sufficient buying power to handle overnight price movements. If your orders are rejected due to buying power, widen the cash buffer through the algorithm $[Settings, T:QuantConnect.AlgorithmSettings] property. The default buffer is 2.5%.</p>
<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="csharp">// Set the cash buffer to 5%
Settings.FreePortfolioValuePercentage = 0.05;</pre>
<pre class="python"># Set the cash buffer to 5%
self.Settings.FreePortfolioValuePercentage = 0.05</pre>
