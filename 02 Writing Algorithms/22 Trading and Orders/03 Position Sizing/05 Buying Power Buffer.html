To ensure a high probability of order fills through market gaps and discontinuities the QuantConnect automatic portfolio methods assume a small built-in cash buffer. This buffer helps ensure you have sufficient buying power to handle overnight price movements. If your orders are rejected due to buying power, widen the cash buffer through the algorithm $[Settings, T:QuantConnect.AlgorithmSettings] property. The default buffer is 2.5%.</p>
<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="csharp">// Set the cash buffer to 5%
Settings.FreePortfolioValuePercentage = 0.05;

// Set the cash buffer to $10,000
Settings.FreePortfolioValue = 10000m;</pre>
<pre class="python"># Set the cash buffer to 5%
self.Settings.FreePortfolioValuePercentage = 0.05

# Set the cash buffer to $10,000
self.Settings.FreePortfolioValue = 10000</pre>
</div>

<p>If you use <code>FreePortfolioValuePercentage</code>, you must set it in the <code>Initialize</code> or <code>PostInitialize</code> event handler. If you use <code>FreePortfolioValue</code>, you must set it after the <code>PostInitialize</code> event handler.</p>
