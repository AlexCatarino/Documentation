You control how optimistic or pessimistic order fills are with <a href="#Trading-and-Orders-Slippage-Transaction-and-Brokerage-Models">transaction model</a> classes. In live trading, the fill price is set by your brokerage when the order is filled.</p><p>In live trading, the orders are filled asynchronously.
