We provide dozens of methods to create, update, and cancel orders. You can place orders <a href="#Trading-and-Orders-Automatic-Position-Sizing-SetHoldings">automatically</a> with helper methods or manually through methods on the algorithm API. You can <a href="#Trading-and-Orders-Updating-Orders">fetch, update, and cancel</a> manual orders with Order Tickets.  As orders are filled and updated, they generate <a href="#Trading-and-Orders-Tracking-Order-Events">events</a> that notify your algorithm about their execution.
