QuantConnect provides dozens of methods to create, update, and cancel orders. These orders can be placed <a href="#Trading-and-Orders-Automatic-Position-Sizing-SetHoldings">automatically</a> with helper methods, or manually through methods on the algorithm API. Manual orders can be <a href="#Trading-and-Orders-Updating-Orders">fetched, updated, and canceled</a> with Order Tickets.  As orders are filled and updated, they generate <a href="#Trading-and-Orders-Tracking-Order-Events">events</a> that notify your algorithm about their execution.

<p>In backtesting, order fills are simulated using historical data. QuantConnect allows you to create your own fill, fee, slippage, and margin models via plugin points. You can control how optimistic or pessimistic these fills are with <a href="#Trading-and-Orders-Slippage-Transaction-and-Brokerage-Models">transaction model</a> classes. In live trading, this fill price is set by your brokerage when the order is filled.</p>
