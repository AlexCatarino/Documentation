<p>All fiat and Crypto currencies are individual assets. When you buy a pair like BTCUSD, you trade USD for BTC. In this case, LEAN removes some USD from your portfolio cash book and adds some BTC. Your position in that trade is represented by the virtual pair BTCUSD, but the virtual pair doesn't exist. It simply represents an open trade.</p>
