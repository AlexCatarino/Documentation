<p>You can place orders <a href="#Trading-and-Orders-Automatic-Position-Sizing-SetHoldings">automatically</a> with helper methods or manually through methods on the algorithm API. A critical concept required before diving into specific order types is the Order Ticket. When you create an order you are given an $[OrderTicket,T:QuantConnect.Orders.OrderTicket] object to update and cancel your order. All orders return an order ticket.</p>

<p>
In live trading, orders are asynchronous, and any operations to update the order must be <i>requested</i> with the order ticket. Whether the update is processed successfully is not guaranteed as the trade may already be filled by the time the request is sent.
