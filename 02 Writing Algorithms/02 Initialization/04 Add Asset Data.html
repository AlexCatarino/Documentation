Algorithms can manually subscribe to data for specific assets they need or use universes to choose groups of assets based on
	filtering criteria (e.g. all stocks with volumes greater than $10M/day). See more about Universes <a class="docs-internal-link" href="/docs/algorithm-reference/universes">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
	To manually subscribe to a specific asset you can call the $[AddEquity(),M:QuantConnect.Algorithm.QCAlgorithm.AddEquity], $[AddForex(),M:QuantConnect.Algorithm.QCAlgorithm.AddForex], $[AddCrypto(),M:QuantConnect.Algorithm.QCAlgorithm.AddCrypto],
	$[AddCfd(),M:QuantConnect.Algorithm.QCAlgorithm.AddCfd] and $[AddOption(),M:QuantConnect.Algorithm.QCAlgorithm.AddOption] methods in your Initialize() method. There is no official limit to how much data
	you can ask for, but there are practical resource limitations. <br></p><p>## TODO: AddFuture, AddFutureOption, AddIndexOption, AddOptionContract, AddFutureContract, AddFutureOptionContract, AddIndexOptionContract<br></p>
<p>
	QuantConnect supports international trading across multiple timezones and markets. The $[Market,T:QuantConnect.Market] parameter is used
	to distinguish between the same tickers on different exchanges (e.g. OANDA offers EURUSD but has different
	rates).
</p>
<p>
	QuantConnect provides 40TB of data. Check out more information about our data in our <a href="/data">data library</a>.
	The resolution of the data available depends on the type of data. For Equities, Futures, Forex, and Crypto we provide Tick,
	Second, Minute, Hourly, and Daily resolution. For Options, we only have minute bar data. These are specified by the
	$[Resolution,T:QuantConnect.Resolution] enum. <br></p><p>## TODO: This 40TB of data is likely outdated. Can we measure this and update the docs programatically?<br></p>
<p>
	If there is a gap in the data (e.g. because there are no trades), by default the data is still pumped into your strategy on
	each time step. This behavior is called "fillForward" and defaults to true. You can disable this by setting fillForward to false. <br></p>

<p>
	If you have your own custom data you'd like to backtest against, check out the <a class="docs-internal-link" href="/docs/algorithm-reference/importing-custom-data">custom data</a> section.

<br>-In live trading, you define the securities you want, but lean also gets the securities in your live portfolio. For the live portfolio securities, it selects the minimum resolution of the subscriptions you created. For example, if you created subscriptions in your algorithm for securities with Second, Minute, and Hour resolutions, the assets in your live portfolio are given a resolution of Second.
