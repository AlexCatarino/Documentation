<p>After the <code>Initialize</code> method, the <code>PostInitialize</code> method performs post initialization routines, so don't override it. To be notified when the algorithm is ready to begin trading, define an <code>OnWarmUpFinished</code> event handler. This method is called even if you don't set a warm up period.</p>


<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="csharp">public override void OnWarmUpFinished()
{
    Log("Algorithm Ready");
}</pre>
<pre class="python">def OnWarmUpFinished(self) -&gt; None:
    self.Log("Algorithm Ready")</pre>
</div>
