<p>
In QuantConnect, we model your algorithm with margin-modeling by default, but you can select a cash account type.
	Cash accounts do not allow leveraged trading, whereas Margin accounts can support leverage on your account value. To set your brokerage and account type, call the $[SetBrokerageModel(BrokerageName brokerage, AccountType account),M:QuantConnect.Algorithm.QCAlgorithm.SetBrokerageModel] method. For more information about each brokerage and their supported account types, see the <a href="/docs/v2/our-platform/live-trading/brokerages">brokerage integration</a> documentation. For more information about the reality models that the brokerage models set, see the <a href="https://www.quantconnect.com/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/reality-modeling/key-concepts">Reality Modeling</a> chapter.<br></p>
