The Initialize method is the entry point of the algorithm where you define a series of settings. Here you can request data, set starting cash, or warm up periods. It is called just once at the start of your algorithm. After the Initialize method is done, we notify your algorithm through the PostInitialize event handler.</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
	<pre class="csharp">public override void PostInitialize()
{
    Log("Algorithm initialized");
}</pre>
	<pre class="python">def PostInitialize(self):
    self.Log("Algorithm initialized")</pre>
