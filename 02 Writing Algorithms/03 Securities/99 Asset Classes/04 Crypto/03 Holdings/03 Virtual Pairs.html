All fiat and Crypto currencies are individual assets. When you buy a pair like BTCUSD, you are trading USD for BTC. In this case, some USD is removed for your Portfolio CashBook and some BTC is added. Your position in that trade is represented by the virtual pair BTCUSD. The virtual pair doesn't exist, it simply represents an open trade. 

<br>-Liquidate only works on virtual positions.
