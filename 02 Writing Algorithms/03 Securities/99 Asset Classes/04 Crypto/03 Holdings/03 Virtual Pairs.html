<p>All fiat and Crypto currencies are individual assets. When you buy a pair like BTCUSD, you trade USD for BTC. In this case, LEAN removes some USD from your portfolio <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/portfolio/cashbook'>cashbook</a> and adds some BTC. The virtual pair BTCUSD represents your position in that trade, but the virtual pair doesn't actually exist. It simply represents an open trade. If you call the <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/trading-and-orders/liquidating-positions'>Liquidate</a> method with the <code>Symbol</code> of a virtual pair, the method only liquidates the quantity in your virtual pair. For more information about liquidating Crypto postitions, see <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/trading-and-orders/crypto-trades'>Crypto Trades</a>.</p>
