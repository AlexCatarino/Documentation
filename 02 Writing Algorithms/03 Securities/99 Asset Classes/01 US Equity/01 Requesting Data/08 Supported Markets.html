<p>To set the market for a security, pass a <code>market</code> argument to the <code>AddEquity</code> method.</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
    <pre class="csharp">_symbol = AddEquity("SPY", market: Market.USA).Symbol;</pre>
    <pre class="python">self.symbol = self.AddEquity("SPY", market=Market.USA).Symbol</pre>
</div>
