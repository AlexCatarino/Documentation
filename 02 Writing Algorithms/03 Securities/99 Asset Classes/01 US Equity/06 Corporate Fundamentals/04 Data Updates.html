<p>The US Fundmamental dataset only provides the originally-reported figures. If there was a mistake in reporting a figure, the data value isn't fixed later. In live trading, Morningstar data is available to your algorithm at approximately 6 AM Eastern Standard Time (EST) each day. The majority of the corporate data update occurs once per month, but the financial ratios update daily. As Morningstar data arrives, we update the master copy of the dataset and pass the data into your algorithm, similar to how <code>TradeBar</code> are fill-forwarded in your data feed. If there have been no updates during a week week, you'll receive the same corporate data.</p>
