The <b>ActiveSecurities</b> lets you select the assets <i>currently</i> in your universe. An active security is a security that is currently selected by the universe or has holdings or open orders. This is useful for iterating over those securities from your universe selection. It has all the same properties as the Securities collection.

## TODO: Include in the Universe and Universe Selection pages too?<div>## TODO: For Active Securities, we should mention the&nbsp;MinimumTimeInUniverse since there is some confusion on why the removed security, even after we liquidate positions, are still in the Active Securities.</div>
