<br>-An individual asset that you can trade. -Security objects allow you to uniquely identify a tradable asset. -Equity is the asset class, AAPL is the security. -The AddEquity/AddCrypto/AddForex/etc methods return a Security object


<br><br>In lean, we model financial securities with the Security class.
<br>The QCAlgorithm class has a Securities object, which is a collection of all the Security objects that have been added to the algorithm during its lifetime. We save them to present the backtest statistics.
