What is a security?
<br>-An individual financial asset that you may (may instead of can, because of indices) trade in a exchange. -Security object models these assets allowing you to uniquely identify a tradable asset. -Equity is the asset class, AAPL is the security. -The AddEquity/AddCrypto/AddForex/etc methods return a Security object


<br><br>- We also use the Security object to model custom data even if the custom data does not represent a tradable asset (e.g., Weather).<br><br>In lean, we model financial securities with the Security class.
<br><div>The QCAlgorithm class has a Securities object, which is a collection of all the Security objects that have been added to the algorithm during its lifetime. We save them to present the backtest statistics.</div><div><br></div><div># Discuss Universe Settings here, or link to Universes &gt; Universe Settings; This way, they don't have to pass all of the arguments to AddEquity everytime<br></div>
