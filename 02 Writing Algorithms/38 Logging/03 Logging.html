Algorithms can save more detailed messaging to log files for later analysis using $[Log(string message),M:QuantConnect.Algorithm.QCAlgorithm.Log]. At the end of the backtest, a link will be presented to view your results. In live trading, a log viewer lets you view log results while the algorithm is running. Because of data vendor limitations, price information cannot be recorded in logs.

If multiple identical messages are sent, they are filtered out. You can intentionally bypass this by adding a timestamp to your log messages.

	Because of vendor limitations, free users are capped to 10kb of logs per backtest with a maximum of 3Mb per day. Users with a subscription can generate up to 100kb of logs per backtest.

## TODO: Add "It's a good practice to add debug/log statements to algorithms running in live mode so that we can understand its behavior and keep records to compare against backtests." Some people deploy silent algorithms in live mode and when it doesn't work as expected, we don't have information to evaluate the problem. Maybe this should go as a Best Practices page in Live Trading too?</div><div>-OnEndOfAlgorithm ("intended for closing out logs")<br></div>
