<p>Common data formats are <span class="public-file-name">CSV</span>, <span class="public-file-name">JSON</span>, and <span class="public-file-name">XML</span>, but you can use any file type that can be read over the internet. Each request has a one-second overhead, so you should package your custom data to minimize requests. Bundle dates together where possible to speed up execution. Just ensure the data in the file is in chronological order.</p>

<p>If you sample a continuous waveform into discrete time steps to create your custom data, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist_frequency" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nyquist frequency</a> states that you must sample the waveform at least twice the frequency of the waveform to avoid aliasing. Aliasing is where you can't construct the original waveform from the samples because the samples were taken too infrequently. For example, if your continuous dataset occurs on a daily basis, you must sample it at least every 12 hours.</p>
