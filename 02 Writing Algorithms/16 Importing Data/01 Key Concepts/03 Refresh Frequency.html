<div>What resolution should you set?</div><div>- Match the resolution of your custom dataset</div><div>- The max reasonable resolute is every minute. Anything more frequent than minute will be very slow to execute.</div><div><br></div><div>What frequency should I sample my custom data source?</div><div>- If you are sampling a continuous waveform into discrete time steps, Nyquist frequency states that you must sample the waveform at least twice the frequency of the waveform to avoid aliasing.</div><div>- Aliasing is where you can't construct the original waveform from the samples because the samples were taken too slowly.</div><div>- For example, if your continuous dataset occurs on a daily basis, you must sample it atleast every 12 hours.<br></div><div><br></div><div>What rate limits are on the datasource?</div><div>- Each data source is unique. Refer to the documentation page of the specific source you're using</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Dropbox</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - GitHub</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - REST</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - FTP</div>
