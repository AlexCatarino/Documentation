<p>Common data formats are <span class="public-file-name">CSV</span>, <span class="public-file-name">JSON</span>, and <span class="public-file-name">XML</span>, but you can use any file type that can be read over the internet. Each request has a one second overhead, so you should package your custom data to minimize requests. Bundle dates together where possible to speed up execution. Just ensure the data in the file is in chronological order.</p>
