<p>If you sample a continuous waveform into discrete time steps to create your custom data, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist_frequency" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nyquist frequency</a> states that you must sample the waveform at least twice the frequency of the waveform to avoid aliasing. Aliasing is where you can't construct the original waveform from the samples because the samples were taken too infrequently. For example, if your continuous dataset occurs on a daily basis, you must sample it at least every 12 hours.</p>
