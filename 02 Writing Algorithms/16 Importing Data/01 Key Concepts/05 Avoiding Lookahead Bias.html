-The data points are injected into your algorithm at the <code>EndTime</code> (<code>Time + Period</code>) that you set in the Reader method. 
<br>-You should set the EndTime to the point of time when the data point is actually available.
<br>-A lot of external sources apply timestamps to data differently than we do. For instance, on some platforms, daily bars are displayed with the date that they opened. We display daily bars with the date they closed. If you set the EndTime to the start of the bar, you'll receive the bar earlier in backtests than you would in live trading (lookahead bias)
