What is look-ahead bias:
<br>-The practice of making decisions using information that would not be available until some time in the future. (from Glossary)

<div><br></div><div>Why is look-ahead bias bad:</div><div>- If look-ahead bias seeps into your algorithm, it will perform differently in live trading and backtesting</div><div>- In backtesting, you'll receive the data earlier than it would actually be available in reality</div><div><br></div><div>How to avoid look-ahead bias:</div>-The data points are injected into your algorithm at the <code>EndTime</code> (<code>Time + Period</code>) that you set in the Reader method. 
<br>-You should set the EndTime to the point of time when the data point is actually available.
<br>-A lot of external sources apply timestamps to data differently than we do. For instance, on some platforms, daily bars are displayed with the date that they opened. We display daily bars with the date they closed. If you set the EndTime to the start of the bar, you'll receive the bar earlier in backtests than you would in live trading
