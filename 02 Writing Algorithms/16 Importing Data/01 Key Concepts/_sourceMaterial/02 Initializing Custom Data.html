<meta name="tag" content="custom data">
<p>
During initialize, your algorithm must use 
	<span class="csharp"><code>AddData&lt;T&gt;(string ticker, Resolution resolution = Resolution.Daily)</code>. 
		This gives LEAN the T-type factory to create the objects, the name of the data, and the resolution at which to poll 
		the data to check for updates.
	</span><span class="python"><code>self.AddData(Type class, string ticker, Resolution resolution = Resolution.Daily)</code>. This gives LEAN the 
		type factory to create the data objects and the resolution to poll the remote data source for updates. 
	</span>
</p>
<p>
	The framework checks for new data as instructed by the <code>Resolution</code> period; i.e. Resolution.Tick polls constantly,
	Resolution.Second polls every second, and Resolution.Minute polls every minute. Hourly and Daily Resolutions are polled every 30 minutes.
</p>
<div class="section-example-container">
	<pre class="csharp">// In Initialize method:
AddData&lt;Weather&gt;("KNYC", Resolution.Daily);
</pre>
	<pre class="python"># In Initialize method:
self.AddData(Weather, "KNYC", Resolution.Minute)
</pre>
</div>
