What frequency should I sample my custom data source?<div>- If you are sampling a continuous waveform into discrete time steps, Nyquist frequency states that you must sample the waveform at least twice the frequency of the waveform to avoid aliasing.</div><div>- Aliasing is where you can't construct the original waveform from the samples because the samples were taken too slowly.</div><div>- For example, if your continuous dataset occurs on a daily basis, you must sample it atleast every 12 hours.<br></div>
