<p>Data types classes in LEAN inherit from the <code>BaseData</code> class that defines the <code>Time</code> and <code>EndTime</code> properties. These properties represent the time period of which the data was built. If the data type occurs in a singular point in time, they have no period, so&nbsp;<code>Time</code> and <code>EndTime</code> are the same. Regardless of the period, LEAN uses the time when the data sample ends, <code>EndTime</code>, to add the sample to a <code>Slice</code>.</p>
