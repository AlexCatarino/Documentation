<p>- To read your external data line-by-line instead of bulk download, you 
need to define a custom data type so that you can read the data source 
and convert it into a form that LEAN is familar with + can use.</p><p>-Unlike custom data; naitive QC data gets the full benefit of security modeling (Splits, dividends etc). Custom data is ignorant of everything about the actual market. Things like market hours, delistings, mergers etc none of that works with Custom data. Its made mostly for indicators</p>
