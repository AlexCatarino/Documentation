<p>- To read your external data line-by-line instead of bulk download, you 
need to define a custom data type so that you can read the data source 
and convert it into a form that LEAN is familar with + can use.</p><p>-Unlike custom data; naitive QC data gets the full benefit of security modeling (Splits, dividends etc). Custom data is ignorant of everything about the actual market. Things like market hours, delistings, mergers etc none of that works with Custom data. Its made mostly for indicators</p>

<p>
	To receive your data in the OnData method, you must create a custom type to instruct LEAN where to get your data and how to read it. All data must extend from $[BaseData,T:QuantConnect.Data.BaseData]
	and override the $[Reader,M:QuantConnect.Data.BaseData.Reader] and $[GetSource,M:QuantConnect.Data.BaseData.Reader] methods. After you define your custom data type, you can create a data subscription in your algorithm and the custom data is injected into your algorithm's <code>OnData</code> method.<br></p>
