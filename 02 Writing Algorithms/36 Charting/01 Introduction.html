We provide a powerful charting API, which you can use to build many chart types. At its simplest, you can plot data with a single line of code:
</p><div class="section-example-container">
		<pre class="csharp">Plot("Series Name", value);</pre>
		<pre class="python">self.Plot("Series Name", value)</pre>
	</div>
<p>To customize the look and feel of your charts, manually initialize them.</p>
