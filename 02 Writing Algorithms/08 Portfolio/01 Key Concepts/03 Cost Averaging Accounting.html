<p>LEAN uses the cost averaging accounting method, which determines the cost of your holdings by taking a weighted average of all your purchase prices. For example, say you place the following buy orders:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Buy 10 ABC @ $10</li>
    <li>Buy 5 ABC @ $11</li>
    <li>Buy 20 ABC @ $14</li>
    <li>Buy 3 ABC @ $9</li>
</ol>

<p>In the preceding example, the average cost of your ABC position is (10*10 + 5*11 + 20*14 + 3*9) / (10 + 5 + 20 + 3) = $12.1579/share. In contrast, if you use the first-in, first-out (FIFO) accounting method, the cost of the first 10 shares is $10/share, not $12.1579/share.</p>
