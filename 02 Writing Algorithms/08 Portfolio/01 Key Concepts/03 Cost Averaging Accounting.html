-The cost averaging accounting method is where you determine the cost of your holdings by taking a weighted-average of all your purchases prices.
<br>-For example, if you place the following buy orders
<br>1) Buy 10 ABC @ $10
<br>2) Buy 5 ABC @ $11
<br>3) Buy 20 ABC @ $14
<br>4) Buy 3 ABC @ $9
<br>Then the average cost of your ABC position is (10*10 + 5*11 + 20*14 + 3*9) / (10 + 5 + 20 + 3) = $12.1579/share

<br>In contrast, if you were to use the FIFO accounting method, the cost of the first 10 shares is $10, not $12.1579.
