<p>## TODO: When are consolidated bars emited? At the end of the period or the start of the following period? Before/After OnData/Update/ScheduledEvents?
</p><p>The result of the consolidation is passed into an <i>event handler</i>. An event handler is a function in your algorithm designed to receive the bar. It can have any name but must have the required parameters.
Depending on how you're using the consolidator system, you must use one of the method patterns below:
</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="csharp">// self.Consolidate() Event Handler
void FortyFiveMinuteBarHandler(TradeBar consolidated) {
}

// Manually Created Event Handler
void ThirtyMinuteBarHandler(object sender, TradeBar consolidated) {
}
</pre>
<pre class="python"># self.Consolidate() Event Handler
def FortyFiveMinuteBarHandler(self, consolidated):
      pass

# Manually Created Event Handler
def ThirtyMinuteBarHandler(self, sender, consolidated):
      pass
</pre>
</div>
