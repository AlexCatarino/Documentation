<p>## TODO: Add an H3 above this one "Add Consolidators" ==&gt; Link to the different types of consolidators in this chapter<br></p><p>The result of the consolidation is passed into an <i>event handler</i>. An event handler is a function in your algorithm designed to receive the bar. It can have any name but must have the required parameters.
Depending on how you're using the consolidator system, you must use one of the method patterns below. If you build the consolidator manually, the consolidation event handler accepts two parameters. If you build the consolidator with the shortcut Consolidate method, the consolidation event handler accepts one parameter.
</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="csharp">// self.Consolidate() Event Handler
void FortyFiveMinuteBarHandler(TradeBar consolidated) {
}

// Manually Created Event Handler
void ThirtyMinuteBarHandler(object sender, TradeBar consolidated) {
}
</pre>
<pre class="python"># self.Consolidate() Event Handler
def FortyFiveMinuteBarHandler(self, consolidated):
      pass

# Manually Created Event Handler
def ThirtyMinuteBarHandler(self, sender, consolidated):
      pass
</pre>
</div>

- Event flow: Scheduled events =&gt; consolidator event handlers =&gt; OnData.
<br><div>- Consolidated bars are emitted when the consolidator period ends. That is, if you consolidate minute-resolution crypto data, you receive the consolidated bar at midnight UTC. If you consolidated minute-resolution Equity data, you receive the consolidated bar at 9:31AM the next day because 4:00pm (closing time) isn't the end of the day.</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - If you are using a bar count consolidator and consolidate 1 bar, the consolidation handler is called before OnData<br></div>
