<p>The result of the consolidation is passed into an <i>event handler</i>. An event handler is a function in your algorithm designed to receive the bar. It can have any name but must have the required parameters.
Depending on how you're using the consolidator system, you must use one of the method patterns below. If you build the consolidator manually, the consolidation event handler accepts two parameters. If you build the consolidator with the shortcut Consolidate method, the consolidation event handler accepts one parameter.
</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="csharp">// Manually Created Event Handler
void ConsolidationHandler(object sender, TradeBar consolidatedBar) {
}

// self.Consolidate() Event Handler
void ConsolidationHandler(TradeBar consolidatedBar) {
}</pre>
<pre class="python"># Manually Created Event Handler
def consolidation_handler(self, sender, consolidated_bar):
      pass

# self.Consolidate() Event Handler
def consolidation_handler(self, consolidated_bar):
      pass</pre>
</div>

- Event flow: Scheduled events =&gt; consolidator event handlers =&gt; OnData.
<br><div>- Consolidated bars are emitted when the consolidated bar closes.</div>
