<p>Consolidating data allows you to create bars of any length from smaller bars. Consolidation is commonly used to combine one-minute price bars into longer bars such as 10-20 minute bars. Consolidated bars are helpful because price movement over a longer period can sometimes contain less noise and bars of exotic length are less researched than standard bars, so they may present more opportunities to capture alpha.</p>

<p>To consolidate data, create a <code>Consolidator</code> object and register it for data. The built-in consolidators make creating longer periods easy and reduces the chance of bugs with custom consolidation techniques. In the following sections, we will introduce the different types of consolidators and show you how to shape data into any form.</p>
