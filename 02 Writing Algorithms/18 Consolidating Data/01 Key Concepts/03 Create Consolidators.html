<p>The process to creating a consolidator depends on the type of consolidator you want to create. For instructions on the various consolidators we support, see <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/consolidating-data/consolidator-types'>Consolidator Types</a>.</p>

<p>
The most common error when creating consolidators is to put parenthesis <code>()</code> at the end of your function name when setting the event handler of the consolidator. If you use parenthesis, the method executes and the result is passed as the event handler instead of the method itself. Remember to pass the name of your method to the event system. Specifically, it should be <code class="csharp">ConsolidationHandler</code><code class="python">self.ConsolidationHandler</code>, not <code class="csharp">ConsolidationHandler()</code><code class="python">self.ConsolidationHandler()</code>.</p>
