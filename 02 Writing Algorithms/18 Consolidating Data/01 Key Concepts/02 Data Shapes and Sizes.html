Consolidated output data is in the same format as the input. Small <a class="docs-internal-link" href="/docs/algorithm-reference/handling-data#Handling-Data-TradeBars">TradeBars</a> are aggregated into large TradeBars, and small <a class="docs-internal-link" href="/docs/algorithm-reference/handling-data#Handling-Data-QuoteBars">QuoteBars</a> are aggregated into large QuoteBars.
