The most common error is to put braces "<code>()</code>" at the end of your function call when setting the event handler of the consolidator. If you use braces, the method executes and the result is passed as the event handler instead of the method itself. Remember to simply pass the name of your method to the event system. Specifically, it should be <code class="csharp">EventHandler</code><code class="python">self.EventHandler</code> not <code class="csharp">EventHandler()</code><code class="python">self.EventHandler()</code>.</p>
