The most common error is to put braces "<code>()</code>" at the end of your function call when defining the event handler. Using braces causes the method to be executed, and the <i>result</i> passed in as the event handler. Remember to simply pass the name of your function to the event system. i.e. It should be <code class="csharp">EventHandler</code><code class="python">self.EventHandler</code> not <code class="csharp">EventHandler()</code><code class="python">self.EventHandler()</code>.</p>
