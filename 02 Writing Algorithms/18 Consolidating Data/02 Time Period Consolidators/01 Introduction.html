What are time period consolidators?
<br>-Time period consolidators aggregate data based on a length of time.
<br>-Data can be aggregated according to a period, with the time of the bars used to perform the consolidation. This requires the input data to be of a lower resolution than the desired consolidation period, e.g. to build a 1.5 hour bar you need minute data. 

<br><br>
Why use time period consolidators?
<br>- To build custom time period bars. For instance, you can aggregate several 1-minute bars to build 7-minute bars, 30-minute bars, or even 1-day bars.
<br>- These time periods are less researched than the standard resolution bars.
