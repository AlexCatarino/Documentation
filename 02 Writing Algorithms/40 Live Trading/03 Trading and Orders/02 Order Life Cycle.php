<p>When the order ticket is created, its status is <code>OrderStatus.New</code>. Before placing the order, LEAN validates it to avoid sending orders that will be rejected by the brokerage. The status of invalid orders is set to <code>OrderStatus.Invalid</code>. LEAN places the valid order, and waits for the brokerage message. If the brokerage accepts the order, its status become <code>OrderStatus.Submitted</code>, otherwise <code>OrderStatus.Canceled</code>.</p>

<p>You can update other orders until they are filled or the brokerage prevents modifications. Before placing the order update request, LEAN validates it to avoid sending orders that will be rejected by the brokerage. The status of invalid orders is set to <code>OrderStatus.Invalid</code>. LEAN sends the update request, and waits for the brokerage message. If the brokerage accepts the update, its status become <code>OrderStatus.UpdateSubmitted</code>, otherwise <code>OrderStatus.Canceled</code>.</p>

<p>The brokerage notifies LEAN when the order is filled (<code>OrderStatus.Filled</code>), partially filled (<code>OrderStatus.PartiallyFilled</code>) or canceled (<code>OrderStatus.Canceled</code>). The order can be canceled before it is completely filled. For example, if the asset price moves before the market open to where you can't afford the quantity of the order, the brokerage rejects your <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/trading-and-orders/order-types/market-on-open-orders"> <code>market-on-open<code></a> order. The brokerage can also cancel your market-on-open order after partial fills if there is no shares left to trade.</p>
