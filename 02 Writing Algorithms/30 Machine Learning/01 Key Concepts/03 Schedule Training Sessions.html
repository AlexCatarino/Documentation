Model training can be scheduled in a similar way to a scheduled event. To do this, you need to pass in a <code>DateRule</code> and <code>TimeRule</code> argument to the <code>Train</code> method. You can see a full list of available date and time rules in the <a href="/docs/algorithm-reference/scheduled-events" class="docs-internal-link">scheduled event</a> documentation.

<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="csharp">// Set TrainingMethod to be executed at 8:00 am every Sunday
Train(DateRules.Every(DayOfWeek.Sunday), TimeRules.At(8, 0), MyTrainingMethod);</pre>
<pre class="python"># Set TrainingMethod to be executed at 8:00 am every Sunday
self.Train(self.DateRules.Every(DayOfWeek.Sunday), self.TimeRules.At(8,0), self.MyTrainingMethod)</pre> 
</div>
<p>We recommend scheduling your training for the evening or early mornings when the market is closed to get the best compute allocation. While the market is open, your CPU is occupied with processing incoming tick data and handling other LEAN events.</p>
