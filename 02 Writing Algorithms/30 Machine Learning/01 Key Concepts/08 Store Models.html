Once models are trained you can store the results into an <i>object store</i>. The object store can be used as a back up of your algorithm variables or to load a complex AI model that you don't wish to re-train. Once stored, your data is backed up on QuantConnect servers until requested.</p>


<p>For examples of storing models from popular machine learning libraries, see Popular Libraries.</p><p><br></p><p># Add H3: Load Models</p><p>-You can load a model that you trained in the Research Environment, or a model from a custom data file (like pickle)</p><p>-Avoid look-ahead bias. Don't train your models on the same data that you are backtesting with.</p>
