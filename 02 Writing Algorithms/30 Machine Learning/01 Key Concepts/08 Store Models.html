Once models are trained you can store the results into an <i>object store</i>. The object store can be used as a back up of your algorithm variables or to load a complex AI model that you don't wish to re-train. Once stored, your data is backed up on QuantConnect servers until requested.</p>


<p>For examples of storing models from popular machine learning libraries, see Popular Libraries.</p><p>- members should save the model into the ObjectStore at the end of the training method (in live mode). In backtesting, save during OnEndOfAlgorithm for algorithm restarts
