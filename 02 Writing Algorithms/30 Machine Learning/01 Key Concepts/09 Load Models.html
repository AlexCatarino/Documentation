<p>You can load machine learning models from the Object Store or a custom data file like pickle. If you load models from the Object Store, before you load the model into your algorithm, in the <code>Initialize</code> method, check if the Object Store already contains the model. To avoid look-ahead bias in backtests, don't train your model on the same data you use to test the model.</p>
