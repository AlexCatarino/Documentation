Once models are trained you can store the results into an <i>object store</i>. This is a permanent project-specific storage location for data located in QuantConnect. Objects are accessible from backtesting and live, and are stored with a key. You can think of this almost like a private project DropBox for your model data. 
</p>
<p>The object store can be used as a back up of your algorithm variables or to load a complex AI model that you don't wish to re-train. Once stored, your data is backed up on QuantConnect servers until requested.</p>
<p>
When deploying a live algorithm, your state is loaded from the object store on deployment. Currently, it is not "refreshed", so you will need to redeploy the live algorithm when you wish to reload your data.
