<p>Algorithms usually must execute the <code>OnData</code> method within 10 minutes, but the <code>Train</code> method allows you to increase this time to train machine learning models. The length of time you can train depends on your training quotas. To train models immediately, call the <code>Train</code> method and pass in the name of your training method.</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="csharp">Train(MyTrainingMethod);</pre>
<pre class="python">self.Train(self.MyMethod)</pre> 
</div>

<p>Immediate training is most useful for training your model when you first deploy your strategy to production or when the model's performance begins to degrade.</p>
