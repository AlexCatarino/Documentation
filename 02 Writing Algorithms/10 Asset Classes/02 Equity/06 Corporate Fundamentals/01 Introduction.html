<p>Corporate data contains all the information on the underlying company of an Equity and the information in their financial statements. Since corporate data contains information not found in price data, adding corporate data to your trading strategies provides more data points to your strategies so you can make more informed trading decisions. Corporate data is provided by the <a href="https://www.quantconnect.com/datasets/morning-star-us-fundamentals">US Fundamental Data from Morningstar</a>.</p>

<p>The Morningstar data covers 5,000 US Equities, starting in January 1998, and is delivered on a daily frequency. This dataset is created by using a combination of string matching, Regular Expressions, and Machine Learning to gather the corporate data published by companies. Using this dataset requires an understanding of <code>CoarseFundamental</code> objects, so the Price data documentation is a prerequisite.</p>
