- When you make a trade inside of a running algorithm we maintain the 
virtual position state for you -- but it won't survive between 
deployments. Some brokerages save your virtual pairs so that they can be
 loaded into your algorithm when you stop and redeploy it. Depending on 
the brokerage you select, you may be able to manually add virtual pairs 
when you deploy live algorithms with the LEAN CLI or cloud deployment 
wizard.
