All fiat and Crypto currencies are individual assets. When you buy a pair like BTCUSD, you are trading USD for BTC. In this case, some USD is removed for your Portfolio CashBook and some BTC is added. Your position in that trade is represented by the virtual pair BTCUSD. The virtual pair doesn't exist, it simply represents an open trade. 

<br>-Liquidate only works on virtual positions.

<br>- When you make a trade inside of a running algorithm we maintain the virtual position state for you -- but it won't survive between deployments. Some brokerages save your virtual pairs so that they can be loaded into your algorithm when you stop and redeploy it. Depending on the brokerage you select, you may be able to manually add virtual pairs when you deploy live algorithms with the LEAN CLI or cloud deployment wizard.
