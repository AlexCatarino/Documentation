What is shorting:
<br>-Taking a negative position; Selling before you buy to close your position
<br>-The trade occurs in reverse order relative to a regular buy->sell order

<br><br>
Why short:
<br>-To bet that a security's price will decrease in the future

<br><br>
How is shorting done:
<br>-You need to borrow shares from another investor before you can sell them on the market. When you buy-to-cover, the shares you buy go back to the original investor.

<br><br>
Risks of shorting:
<br>-Margin calls; complete liquidation of your portfolio;
<br>-Incurring borrowing costs
