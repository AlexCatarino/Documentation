<p>Fungible assets are assets that are interchangeable with each other. For example, every share of common stock for a company is effectively identical to every other share of common stock from the same company. In contrast, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are non-fungible because each one is unique. QuantConnect doesn't currently support trading non-fungible assets.</p>
