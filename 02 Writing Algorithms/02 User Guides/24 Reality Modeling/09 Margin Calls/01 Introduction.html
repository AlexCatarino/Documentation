<h4>Margin call model
What is the margin call model
-The model responsible for picking which orders should be executed during a margin call

Why is there a margin call model:
-To ensure the portfolio stays within margin limits specified by the brokerage.
-To execute synchronous orders to bring the account within margin requirements.
-To liquidate the portfolio immediately before the portfolio gets sub zero if there is a margin call,
-To scan the portfolio and the updated data for a potential margin call situation which may get the holdings below zero

What margin call models are supported:
-DefaultMarginCallModel: orders the generated margin call orders by the unrealized profit (losers first) and executes each order synchronously until we're within the margin requirements
-You can create your own
