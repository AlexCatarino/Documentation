QuantConnect provides dozens of methods to create, update, and cancel orders. These orders can be placed <a href="#Trading-and-Orders-Automatic-Position-Sizing-SetHoldings">automatically</a> with helper methods, or manually through methods on the algorithm API. Manual orders can be <a href="#Trading-and-Orders-Updating-Orders">fetched, updated, and canceled</a> with Order Tickets.  As orders are filled and updated, they generate <a href="#Trading-and-Orders-Tracking-Order-Events">events</a> that notify your algorithm about their execution. 
</p>

<p>In backtesting, order fills are simulated using historical data. QuantConnect allows you to create your own fill, fee, slippage, and margin models via plugin points. You can control how optimistic or pessimistic these fills are with <a href="#Trading-and-Orders-Slippage-Transaction-and-Brokerage-Models">transaction model</a> classes. In live trading, this fill price is set by your brokerage when the order is filled.</p>


<h4>What is an Order Ticket?</h4>
<p>
A critical concept required before diving into specific order types is the Order Ticket. When you create an order you are given an $[OrderTicket,T:QuantConnect.Orders.OrderTicket] object to update and cancel your order. All orders return an order ticket.
</p>
<p>
In live trading, orders are asynchronous, and any operations to update the order must be <i>requested</i>. Whether the update is processed successfully is not guaranteed as the trade may already be filled by the time the request is sent.

In the following sections, we'll explore how to use the Order Ticket to update and cancel orders you have created.
