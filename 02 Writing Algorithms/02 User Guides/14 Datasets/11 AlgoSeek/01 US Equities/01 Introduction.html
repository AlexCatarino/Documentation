<p>US Equity price data by AlgoSeek is survivorship bias-free daily coverage of every stock traded in the US SIP (CTA/UTP) feed since 2007. The data covers approximately 24,000 securities, starting in January 2007, and is delivered daily down to tick resolution. Data is collected from the full SIP (Securities Information Processors) feed via our Equinix co-lo servers, including all trades and quotes published to every exchange as well as FINRA. Over-the-Counter (OTC) trades are not included.</p>

<p>This dataset depends on the <a href="https://www.quantconnect.com/datasets/quantconnect-us-equity-security-master">US Equity Security Master</a> dataset because the US Equity Security Master dataset contains information on splits, dividends, and symbol changes.</p>
