<!-- 
<p>We are a quant platform, so all data is loaded using "As Original Reported" figures. If there was a mistake reporting the figure, the data value will not be fixed later. In live trading, Morningstar data is delivered to your algorithm at approximately 6am each day. The majority of the corporate data update occurs once per month. This includes updates to all of the key information for each security Morningstar supports. On top of this monthly update, there are daily updates of the financial ratios.</p>

<p>As Morningstar data arrives, it updates the master copy and is passed into your algorithm, similar to how TradeBars are fill-forwarded in your data feed. If there have been no updates this week, you'll receive the same corporate data.</p>
