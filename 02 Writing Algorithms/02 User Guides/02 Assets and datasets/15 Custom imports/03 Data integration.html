<p>There are two ways to get custom data into your trading algorithm. You can use the <code>Download</code> method to import a single static reference file. Alternatively, you can define a custom data reader class to sequentially stream data points into your algorithm. When you specify the source URL as a REST endpoint in your custom data reader, the URL provided is polled at each resolution time step and is assumed to be sufficient for one data point.</p>
