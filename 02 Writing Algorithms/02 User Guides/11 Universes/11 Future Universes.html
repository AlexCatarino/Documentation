<p>
When you add a futures asset to your algorithm, it adds all the contracts which match your filter as a universe of futures contracts in a similar way to option. The primary difference is that futures don't have a strike price, so the universe filter is primarily focused on the future expiration date.</p>
<p>For more information on selecting futures universes, see the <a class="docs-internal-link" href="/docs/data-library/futures">Futures</a> section in Data Library documentation.
