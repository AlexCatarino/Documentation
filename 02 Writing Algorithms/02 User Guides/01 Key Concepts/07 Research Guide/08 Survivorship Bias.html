 <div>What is survivorship bias:</div>
 <div>-Testing a strategy only on securities that have made it, omitting securities that have been delisted</div><div>-If you use the current constituents of an index and backtest over the past, you'll outperform the index because many of the underperforms have dropped out of the index over time and outperformers have been added to the index. The current constituent universe would consistent only of outperformers.<br></div><div>-It's a form of look-ahead bias because if you were trading the strategy in real-time throughout the backtest, you would not know the index constituents until the end of the backtest.<br></div>

 <div>Why is survivorship bias an issue:</div>
 <div>-In
 some trading platforms it's an issue because your strategy will have 
inflated performance in history, only being tested on securities that 
have proven to be successful<br></div>
<div>-Survivorship bias is not an issue since our datasets are free of survivorship bias</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Even if a security was delisted, it's included in backtest simulations</div><div>-If you analyze a dataset that has survivorship bias, you can discover results that are opposite of the true results. For example, in Seven Sins of Quantitative Investing (2014), Wang et al. analyze the low volatility factor using 2 universes: one using the current S&amp;P constituents and one using the point-in-time constituents. When they use the point-in-time constituents, the low volatility quintile outperforms the high volatility quintile. When they use the current constituents, the high volatility quintile significantly outperforms the low volatility quintile. </div><div><br></div><div>To avoid issues with survivorship bias, use a universe that is dynamically adjusted, point-in-time<br></div><div>-&nbsp;Explain how to avoid in your algorithm (with universe selection), link to universe selection</div>
