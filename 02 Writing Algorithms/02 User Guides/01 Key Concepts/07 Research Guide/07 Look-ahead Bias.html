	<div>What is look-ahead bias<br></div>
	<div>-Using information in the future to make decisions in the present</div>
	<div><br></div><div>Example of look-ahead bias:</div><div>- Using financial statement data to make trading decisions at the end of the reporting period instead of when the financial statement data was released.</div><div>- Using revised/updated financial statement data before the updated figures were actually available. <br></div><div><br></div>
	<div>Why is look-ahead bias a risk:</div>
	<div>-Selecting a universe of securities that have performed well in recent history</div>
	<div>-Selecting indicators and indicator values that have performed well in recent history</div>
	-By running multiple optimizations/backtests, you incorporate results of past tests into the new tests
</div>


<div>- Avoided to some extent by using the backtesting environment since it's event driven and you can't pass the time frontier</div>
<div>- To avoid: It's best to use a dynamic universe instead of selecting a manual universe with securities that you know have performed well</div>
