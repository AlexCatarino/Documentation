	<div>What is look-ahead bias<br></div>
	<div>-Using information in the future to make decisions in the present</div>
	<div><br></div><div>Example of look-ahead bias:</div><div>(1) <br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Using financial statement data to make trading decisions at the end of the reporting period instead of when the financial statement data was released.</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Using revised/updated financial statement data before the updated figures were actually available. <br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp; - In Seven Sins of Quantitative Investing (2014), Wang et al. show that using the date of when the period ends instead of when the data is actually available can increase the performance of the earnings yield factor by 60%.</div><div>(2) <br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Using adjusted prices</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Splits or reverse splits can occur to improve liquidity or attract certain investors, so the performance of the stock may have been different without the split/reverse split.<br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Using adjusted prices incorporates information from the future into the current time in the backtest</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp; - In even Sins of Quantitative Investing (2014), Wang et al. build a portfolio using the 25 lowest price stocks in the S&amp;P index based on adjusted and unadjusted prices. The one based on adjusted prices greatly outperforms the one with raw prices in terms of return and Sharpe ratio. If you were to analyze the low price factor with adjusted prices, it would lead you to believe the factor is very informative, but it would not perform well out-of-sample (with raw data).<br></div><div><br></div>
	<div>Why is look-ahead bias a risk:</div>
	<div>-Selecting a universe of securities that have performed well in recent history</div>
	<div>-Selecting indicators and indicator values that have performed well in recent history</div>
	-By running multiple optimizations/backtests, you incorporate results of past tests into the new tests
</div>


<div>- Avoided to some extent by using the backtesting environment since it's event driven and you can't pass the time frontier</div>
<div><br></div><div>- To avoid: <br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - It's best to use a dynamic universe instead of selecting a manual universe with securities that you know have performed well</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Use point-in-time data. If it's not available, apply a reporting lag.<br></div>
