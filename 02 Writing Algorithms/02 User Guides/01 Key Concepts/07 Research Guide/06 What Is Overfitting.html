<p>
    Overfitting happens when the parameters of an algorithm are fine-tuned to fit the detail and noise of backtesting data to the extent that it negatively impacts the performance of the algorithm on new data. The problem is that the parameters do not necessarily apply to new data and thus negatively impact the algorithm's ability to generalize and trade well in all market conditions.

    Overfitting can manifest itself in several ways:

An algorithm that is dynamic and generalizes to new data is more valuable to funds and individual investors. It is more likely to survive across different market conditions and apply to new asset classes and markets.
