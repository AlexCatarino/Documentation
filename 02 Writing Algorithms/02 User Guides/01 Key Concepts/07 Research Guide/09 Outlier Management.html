How are outliers usually handled:<br>&nbsp;- Leaving them in the data (outliers may contain useful information)<br>&nbsp;- Trimming them out by winsorization or IQR truncation<br>&nbsp;- Using factor ranks instead of raw factor values<br><br>-Winsorization method removes outliers in the x% of the extremes<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Often subjective<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; - The percentile can change over time or based on the application.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Can result in overfitting<br><br><div>-IQR method</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Outliers are identified if they fall outside of the range [ Q1− k( Q3 − Q1 ), Q3 + k(Q3 − Q1) ] for some constant k &gt;= 0.</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - This method can exclude up to 25% of observations on each side of the extremes<br></div>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Doesn't work if the data is skewed or non-normal. Therefore, the downside is the you need to review the factor distribution properties. <br><div>&nbsp;&nbsp; - If you need to, you can normalize the data with z-scores.</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - &lt;add z-score formula&gt;<br></div><br><div>-Factor ranking method</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Taking the rank of the factor relative to the other securities, rather than taking the raw factor value.<br></div>&nbsp;&nbsp; - This method transforms the data into a uniform distribution.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; - After converting to a uniform distribution, Wang et al. perform an inverse normal transformation to make the factors normally distributed.<br><br>-Wang et al. research finds that the ranking transformation outperforms the z-score transformation, suggesting that the distance between factor scores doesn't add information (just noise), only the ranking matters.<p></p>
