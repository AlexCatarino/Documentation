<p>How does data flow through algorithm?</p>
<ol>
<li>Boot Up</li>
<p>Explain that in live mode, using a real brokerage, that it includes fetching the information of the account: cashbook, positions and open orders</p>
<li>Initialize</li>
<p>The Initialize method is only called once and is used to configure your algorithm by setting the date range, the data subscriptions and setting the models</p>
<li>Init Data to LEAN</li>
<p>The engine will look at the date range and the data susbcriptions to create the data stream that will be consumed by your algorithm</p>
<li>Load Subscriptions</li>
<li>Pass subscriptions back to the OnData</li>
<p>Data is synchonized and delived to OnData as a Slice object</p>
<li>Orders -&gt; LEAN; LEAN Order Events -&gt; Algorithm<br>&nbsp;- Scheduled Events -&gt; Algorithm</li>
<li>Diagram</li>
