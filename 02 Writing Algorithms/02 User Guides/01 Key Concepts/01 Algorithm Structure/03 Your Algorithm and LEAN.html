  <li>consolidatorsHow does your algorithm plug into LEAN?</li>
  <p>Your algorithm is a subclass of QCAlgorithm that is loaded into the engine during the building/compilation process. It means that changes to your algorithm require a new compilation.</p>
  <li>What does LEAN Manage for your Algorithm?</li>
  <p>LEAN runs an algorithm manager that synchronizes the data that your algorithm susbcribed to, updates your algorithm state (e.g. the price of the securities, condolidators, indicators), processes the orders, and deliver the data for trading decisions.</p>
