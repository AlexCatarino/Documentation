<div>What is overfitting:</div>
<div>
	<div>-Modeling to closely to the past</div>
	<div>-Selecting parameters that work extremely well in the past</div>
	<div>-parameters are fine-tuned to fit the detail and noise of backtesting data to the extent
 that it negatively impacts the performance of the algorithm on new data</div>
 	<div><br></div>
 	<div>Why is overfitting a problem:</div>
 	<div>-If you create a trading model that's modeled too closely to the past, 
it may not be robust enough to work in live trading / out of sample</div>
	<div>-  negatively impacts the algorithm's ability to generalize and trade well in all market conditions</div>
	<div>- An algorithm that is dynamic and generalizes to new data is more valuable to funds and individual investors. It is more likely to survive across different market conditions and apply to new asset classes and markets.</div>

	<div>Why does overfitting occur:</div>- From over-optimizing <br>
</div>

<div>- Having too many algorithm parameters</div>
