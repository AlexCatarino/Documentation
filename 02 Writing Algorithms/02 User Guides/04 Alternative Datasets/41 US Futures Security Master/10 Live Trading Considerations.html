<p>
It is possible to trade the continuous futures. However, the canonical symbol created by the <i>AddFuture</i> method is not mapped to a single underlying future contract but represents a set of rolling contracts. Thus, the prices could be frictional during a symbol-changing event. This could be catastrophic in live trading! For live trading, the orders should be placed directly on the underlying contracts. The underlying contract is available with the <b><i>Mapped</i></b> property.
