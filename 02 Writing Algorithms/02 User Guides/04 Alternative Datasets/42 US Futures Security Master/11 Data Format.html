A factor file and a map file will be included in the downloaded local files for each of the exchanges with supported continuous futures. They could be found in <i>\data\future\exchange_name</i> under the LEAN CLI base directory.
<br /><br />
For the factor file, it is a .zip collection of REST API styled .csv files for each future symbol, including the date, scaling factors for each type of data normalization and the data mapping mode that indicates the symbol-changing event is on that day for that mapping mode. Example of how a line in the .csv file looks like:
</p>
<code>{"Date":"2009-10-31T00:00:00","BackwardsRatioScale":[0.9914163090128755364806866953,1.0,1.0],"BackwardsPanamaCanalScale":[-2.0,0.0,0.0],"ForwardPanamaCanalScale":[0.0,0.0,0.0],"DataMappingMode":1}
</code>
<br /><br /><p>For the map file, it is a .zip collection of .csv files for each future symbol, including the date, new underlying contract symbol, the exchange code and the data mapping mode that indicates the symbol-changing event is on that day for that mapping mode. Example of how a line in the .csv file looks like:</p>
