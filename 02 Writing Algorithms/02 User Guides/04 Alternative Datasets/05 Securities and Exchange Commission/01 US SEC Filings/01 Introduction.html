<p>The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires that publicly traded companies in the U.S. report their quarterly financial earnings each quarter. The data is sourced from the SEC's Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval (EDGAR) system. QuantConnect downloads and formats the Quarterly Financial Reports (10-Q) and Annual Financial Report (8-K) filings of companies into a format for easy consumption by LEAN.
