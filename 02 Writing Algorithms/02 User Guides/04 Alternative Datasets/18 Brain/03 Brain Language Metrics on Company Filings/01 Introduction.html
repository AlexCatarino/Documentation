<li>Percentage of words belonging to financial domain classified by language types (e.g. “litigious” or “constraining” language)<\/li>
<li>Readability score<\/li>
<li>Lexical metrics such as lexical density and richness<\/li>
<li>Text statistics such as the report length and the average sentence length<\/li>
<\/ol><p>The second part includes the differences between the two most recent 10-Ks or 10-Qs reports of the same period for each company, namely:<\/p>
<ol><li>Difference of the various language metrics (e.g. delta sentiment, delta readability score, delta percentage of a specific language type etc.)<\/li>
<li>Similarity metrics between documents, also with respect to a specific language type (for example similarity with respect to “litigious” language or “uncertainty” language)<\/li>
