<h4>Buying power model
What is the buying power model:
- Buying power models (also known as margin models) control how much buying power (leverage) your algorithm has to make trades.
-If we place an order, Lean uses the buying power model to decide whether the order should be submitted. With this operation, we avoid placing orders that would be rejected by the brokerage.

Why is there a buying power model:
- Buying power calculations can be very complex and depend on many factors, including the brokerage or even time of day.
- To model intraday pattern day trading for US equities (PDT rule)

What buying power models are supported:
-ConstantBuyingPowerModel: Uses an absurdly low margin requirement to ensure all orders have sufficient margin provided the portfolio is not underwater
-CashBuyingPowerModel
-BuyingPowerModel
-PatternDayTradingMarginModel
-You can create your own
