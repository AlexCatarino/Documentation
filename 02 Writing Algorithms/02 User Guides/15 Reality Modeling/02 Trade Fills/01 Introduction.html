What is portfolio modelling:
    - Portfolio models control how order fills are applied to your portfolio.
    - Portfolios are semi-closed systems (closed except for when you're depositing/withdrawing funds or fees are incurred) where their state is updated over time
        - The equity of the portfolio just transitions between assets (cash and securities)
        - The equity doesn't change. What changes is the value of the things we buy
        - The portfolio has the holdings that are updated by the orders

Why is there portfolio modeling:
    - To realistically model how a portfolio changes in response to order fills (including fees)
    - To track/update the average price of security holdings with each order fill

How(?):
   - Portfolio models take an OrderEvent, Security, and SecurityPortfolioManager object and update the holdings to reflect the new final position.
   - You should only need to update your portfolio model when you are creating a new asset type.
   - The portfolio model interacts with the Settlement model and fee model that are part of the brokerage model</p>
   
   
   What are fill models:
-Fill models control how each type of order is filled

Why are there fill models:
-To determine at what price orders are filled at and the quantity of fills (partial or full)
-To determine a price to fill limit orders
-To incorporate spread costs (if necessary)
-To work with the slippage model to add slippage into the fill price of orders
-To fill orders at the official Opening and Closing auction prices (for equities)

What fill models are supported:
-ImmediateFillModel (default): Fills orders using the last trade price of the security
-LatestPriceFillModel: This fill model is provided because currently the data sourced for Crypto is limited to one minute snapshots for Quote data. This fill model will ignore the trade/quote distinction and return the latest pricing information in order to determine the correct fill price
-EquityFillModel: Incorporates the bid-ask spread for equity trades
