<h4>Short availability model
What is the short availability model:
-A model that tracks the number of shares that are available to be borrowed for shorting

Why is there a short availability model:
-If you have a trading strategy that shorts, you'll need to know if there are shares available to short.
-Without a short availability model, your backtest results can be unrealistic. If, for example, you're shorting penny stocks that don't actually have shares available to short at the time of your trade.
-To ensure your backtest short trades are realistic. -- If the performance can continue in live trading.
