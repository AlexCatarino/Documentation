<p>This page explains how to creates a new Donchian Channel indicator which will compute the Upper Band and Lower Band. The indicator will be automatically updated on the given resolution.</p>
                        
<p>This indicator computes the upper and lower band of the Donchian Channel. The upper band is computed by finding the highest high over the given period. The lower band is computed by finding the lowest low over the given period. The primary output value of the indicator is the mean of the upper and lower band for the given timeframe.</p>
