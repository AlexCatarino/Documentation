<p>This page explains how to creates an <code>EaseOfMovementValue</code> indicator for the symbol. The indicator will be automatically updated on the given resolution.</p>
                        
<p>This indicator computes the n-period Ease of Movement Value using the following: MID = (high_1 + low_1)/2 - (high_0 + low_0)/2 RATIO = (currentVolume/10000) / (high_1 - low_1) EMV = MID/RATIO _SMA = n-period of EMV Returns _SMA Source: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/easeofmovement.asp</p>
