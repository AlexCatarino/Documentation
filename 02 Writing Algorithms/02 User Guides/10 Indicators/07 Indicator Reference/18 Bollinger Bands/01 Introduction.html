<p>This page explains how to creates a new <code>BollingerBands</code> indicator which will compute the MiddleBand, UpperBand, LowerBand, and StandardDeviation</p>
                        
<p>This indicator creates a moving average (middle band) with an upper band and lower band fixed at k standard deviations above and below the moving average.</p>
