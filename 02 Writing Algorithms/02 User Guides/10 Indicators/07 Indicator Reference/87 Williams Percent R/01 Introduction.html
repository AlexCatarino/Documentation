<p>Williams %R, or just %R, is the current closing price in relation to the high and low of the past N days (for a given N). The value of this indicator fluctuates between -100 and 0. The symbol is said to be oversold when the oscillator is below -80%, and overbought when the oscillator is above -20%.</p>
