<p>This page explains how to creates a new <code>TrueRange</code> indicator.</p>
                        
<p>This indicator computes the True Range (TR). The True Range is the greatest of the following values: value1 = distance from today's high to today's low. value2 = distance from yesterday's close to today's high. value3 = distance from yesterday's close to today's low.</p>
