<p>This page explains how to creates a new <code>AroonOscillator</code> indicator which will compute the AroonUp and AroonDown (as well as the delta)</p>
                        
<p>The Aroon Oscillator is the difference between AroonUp and AroonDown. The value of this indicator fluctuates between -100 and +100. An upward trend bias is present when the oscillator is positive, and a negative trend bias is present when the oscillator is negative. AroonUp/Down values over 75 identify strong trends in their respective direction.</p>
