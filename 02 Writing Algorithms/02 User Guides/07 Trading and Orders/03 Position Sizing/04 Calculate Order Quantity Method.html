<h4>Manually Calculating Quantity Targets</h4>
<p>
If you are looking to size positions but not use <i>market orders</i> for the trades, you can use the $[CalculateOrderQuantity, M:QuantConnect.Algorithm.QCAlgorithm.CalculateOrderQuantity] method to get an accurate estimate of the number of shares available to purchase with a given buying power fraction. The share quantity is calculated based on the current price of the asset and adjusted for the fee model attached to that security.

<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="csharp">// Calculate the fee adjusted quantity of shares with given buying power
var quantity = CalculateOrderQuantity("IBM", 0.4);
LimitOrder("IBM", quantity, Securities["IBM"].Price);
</pre>
<pre class="python"> # Calculate the fee adjusted quantity of shares with given buying power
quantity = self.CalculateOrderQuantity("IBM", 0.4)
self.LimitOrder("IBM", quantity, self.Securities["IBM"].Price)
</pre>
