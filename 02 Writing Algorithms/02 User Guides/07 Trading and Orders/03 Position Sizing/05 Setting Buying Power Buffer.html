<h4>Cash Buffer Setting</h4>
<p>
To ensure a high probability of order fills through market gaps and discontinuities the QuantConnect automatic portfolio methods assume a small built-in cash buffer. This buffer helps ensure you have sufficient buying power to handle overnight price movements. If you are seeing orders get rejected due to buying power, you can configure this buffer to provide a wider buffer. By default, the buffer is set to 2.5%. The buffer lives on the algorithm $[Settings, T:QuantConnect.AlgorithmSettings] property.
