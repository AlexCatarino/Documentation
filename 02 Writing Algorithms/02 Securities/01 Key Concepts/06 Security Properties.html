Algorithms have a $[Securities,P:QuantConnect.Algorithm.QCAlgorithm.Securities] property that stores a $[Security,T:QuantConnect.Securities.Security] object for each asset in
    your algorithm. Security objects hold the models (backtesting behaviors) and properties of an asset. Each security
    can be completely customized to behave as you'd like. Securities is a <code>Dictionary&lt;Symbol,
    Security&gt;</code> so you can access your Security objects with their ticker <code>Securities["IBM"].Price</code>.

    Security objects also carry all the models for creating realistic backtests. These models are set via the public
    security properties and then used in LEAN to improve your backtest realism.
