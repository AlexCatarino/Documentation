<p>To create manual indicators, instantiate an indicator with its constructor. To view all of the available indicators and their constructors, see the Indicator Reference.</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
    <pre class="csharp">private Delay _delay;

_delay = new Delay(20);</pre>
    <pre class="python">self.delay = Delay(20)</pre>
</div>

<p>You can track indicators by their name. To name a manual indicator, pass a string as the first argument to the constructor.</p>
<div class="section-example-container">
    <pre class="csharp">_delay = new Delay("AAPL Past Price", 20);
Log(_delay.Name);</pre>
    <pre class="python">self.delay = Delay("AAPL Past Price", 20)
self.Log(self.delay.Name)</pre>
</div>
<p>If you don't name an indicator, it's given a default name. For example, the default name for a <code>Delay</code> indicator is "Delay(<span class="placeholder-text">period</span>)".</p>
