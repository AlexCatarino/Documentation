<p>QCAlgorithm provides a shortcut method for each indicator available. Each method creates an indicator object, hooks it up for automatic updates, and returns it to be used in your algorithm.</p>
<p>The indicator resolution can be different from the resolution of your securities data. However, the resolution of the indicator should be equal to or higher than the resolution of your security. In most cases, this usage should be in the Initialize method. If you call this method several times, it will create a new indicator that is not ready to use. </p>


<div class="section-example-container">
    <pre class="csharp">private SimpleMovingAverage _sma;

// In Initialize()
var symbol = AddEquity("SPY").Symbol;
_sma = SMA(symbol, 20, Resolution.Daily);</pre>
    <pre class="python"># In Initialize()
symbol = self.AddEquity("SPY").Symbol
self.sma = self.SMA(symbol, 20, Resolution.Daily)</pre>
