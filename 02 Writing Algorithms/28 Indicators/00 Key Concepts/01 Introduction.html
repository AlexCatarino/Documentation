	We provide more than 100 technical indicators for you to use in your algorithm. These are provided in two ways: through helper short cut methods, and as class objects. Indicators created through the short cut methods have already been wired up to receive data and are "ready to use". A full list of the indicators and their properties can be found in the reference table below.

	One key indicator to learn is the $[Identity,T:QuantConnect.Indicators.Identity] indicator, which simply returns the value of the asset. This can be useful for combining indicators. For example:
</p>
<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="csharp">var pep = Identity("PEP");     // Pepsi ticker
var coke = Identity("KO");     // Coke ticker
var delta = pep.Minus(coke);   // Difference between them
</pre>
<pre class="python">pep = Identity("PEP")   # Pepsi ticker
coke = Identity("KO")   # Coke ticker
delta = IndicatorExtensions.Minus(pep, coke)   # Difference between them
</pre>

## TODO: <br></div><div>- Add new h3: Differences from Third-Party Indicators (https://github.com/QuantConnect/Documentation/issues/272)</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp; - You need to compare the price values, because if the prices are slightly different the indicators will be different. We validate the indicators against third party sources and when the values are the same, the indicator values are similar too.</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp; - We timestamp our data to the time when the period ends. Lots of other platforms timestamp to the beginning of the candle.</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Check if the implementation of the indicators is the same. Sometimes the MovingAverageType can be different<br></div><div>- Add Indicator Status https://github.com/QuantConnect/Documentation/blob/b602964a43988cec4f07488bb04f1287d03a1834/02%20Algorithm%20Reference/09%20Indicators/02%20Indicator%20Ready.html</div><div>- Shortcut method vs full class name</div><div>- To use indicators in a universe model, see (link to doc)</div><div>- How to remove indicator consolidators</div><div>- all indicators are implicitly converted to a decimal.
Note:
This is not try in Python, that's why we need to use Currect.Value where Value is a decimal, but in C#, we can do
sma > 10
while in Python, we need:
sma.Current.Value > 10 <br></div>
