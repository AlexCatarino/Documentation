	We provide more than 100 technical indicators for you to use in your algorithm. These are provided in two ways: through helper short cut methods, and as class objects. Indicators created through the short cut methods have already been wired up to receive data and are "ready to use". A full list of the indicators and their properties can be found in the reference table below.

	One key indicator to learn is the $[Identity,T:QuantConnect.Indicators.Identity] indicator, which simply returns the value of the asset. This can be useful for combining indicators. For example:
</p>
<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="csharp">var pep = Identity("PEP");     // Pepsi ticker
var coke = Identity("KO");     // Coke ticker
var delta = pep.Minus(coke);   // Difference between them
</pre>
<pre class="python">pep = Identity("PEP")   # Pepsi ticker
coke = Identity("KO")   # Coke ticker
delta = IndicatorExtensions.Minus(pep, coke)   # Difference between them
</pre>
