<p>You can access current and historical indicator values.</p>

<h4>Current Indicator Values</h4>

<p>To access the indicator value, use <code>.Current.Value</code>. Each indicator has a property that is used to evaluate the <code>.Current.Value</code>. The SimpleMovingAverage indicator only has one output, namely, the simple moving average over the last n periods. Some indicators have multiple outputs. For example, the BollingerBand indicator has a simple moving average, an upper band, and a lower band. For indicators that have multiple outputs, refer to the Indicator Reference to see how to access the output values.</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
	<pre class="python">sma = self.sma.Current.Value

current_price = self.bb.Current.Value
bb_upper_band = self.bb.UpperBand.Current.Value
bb_lower_band = self.bb.LowerBand.Current.Value</pre>
	<pre class="csharp fsharp">var sma = self.sma.Current.Value

var currentPrice = self.bb.Current.Value
var bbUpperBand = self.bb.UpperBand.Current.Value
var bbLowerBand = self.bb.LowerBand.Current.Value</pre>
</div><br><div>- all indicators are implicitly converted to a decimal.
Note:
This is not try in Python, that's why we need to use Currect.Value where Value is a decimal, but in C#, we can do
sma &gt; 10
while in Python, we need:
sma.Current.Value &gt; 10 <br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp; - I think that in Python 
sma1 &gt; sma2 also works because they have the same type, the problem 
is the missing implementation of implicit conversion.</div><h4>Historical Indicator Values</h4>
