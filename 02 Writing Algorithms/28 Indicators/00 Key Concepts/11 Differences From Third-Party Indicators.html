<p>The values of our indicators can sometimes produce different results than the indicators on other platforms. These discrepancies can be a result of differences in the input data, timestamps, or implementation.</p>

<h4>Price Differences</h4>

<p>If you find differences in indicator values, compare the prices that are fed into the indicator on each platform. If the input data is slightly different, the indicator values will be different. To test if it's a difference in price data, feed in the data from the third-party platform into our indicators. We validate the indicators against third party sources and when the values are the same, the indicator values are similar too.</p>

<h4>Timestamp Differences</h4>

<p>We timestamp our data to the time when the period ends. Lots of other platforms timestamp to the beginning of the candle.</p>

<h4>Implementation Differences</h4>

<p>Some indicators can be have slightly different default arguments for their implementation. A common difference accross platforms is to use different a <code>MovingAverageType</code> for the indicators. To see the default arguments for all our indicators, see the Indicator Reference in the menu.</p>
