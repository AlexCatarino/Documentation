<p>The Object Store is a project-specific file system that you can use in your algorithms to save, read, and delete data. The Object Store works like a key-value storage system where you can store regular strings, JSON encoded strings, XML encoded strings, and bytes. You can access the data you store in the Object Store from backtests, the Research Environment, and live algorithms.</p>

<p>When you deploy live algorithms, the state of the Object Store is copied, but it never refreshes. Therefore, if you save data in the Object Store in a live algorithm, you can access the data from the live algorithm, backtests, and the Research Environment. However, if you save content into the Object Store from the Research Environment or a backtest after you deploy a live algorithm, you won't be able to access the new content from the live algorithm.</p>
