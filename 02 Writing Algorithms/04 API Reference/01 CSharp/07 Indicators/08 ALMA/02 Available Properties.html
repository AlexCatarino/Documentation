<p>The <code>ALMA</code> method has the following properties:<br/><ul><li>WarmUpPeriod<br/>Required period, in data points, for the indicator to be ready and fully initialized.</li></ul></p><ul><li>Period<br/>Smooth and high sensitive moving Average. This moving average reduce lag of the information but still being smooth to reduce noises. Is a weighted moving average, which weights have a Normal shape; the parameters Sigma and Offset affect the kurtosis and skewness of the weights respectively.
