<p>The <code>FISH</code> method has the following properties:<br/><ul><li>IsReady<br/>Gets a flag indicating when this indicator is ready and fully initialized</li></ul></p><ul><li>WarmUpPeriod<br/>Required period, in data points, for the indicator to be ready and fully initialized.</li></ul></p><ul><li>Current<br/>The Fisher transform is a mathematical process which is used to convert any data set to a modified data set whose Probability Distribution Function is approximately Gaussian. Once the Fisher transform is computed, the transformed data can then be analyzed in terms of it's deviation from the mean. The equation is y = .5 * ln [ 1 + x / 1 - x ] where x is the input y is the output ln is the natural logarithm The Fisher transform has much sharper turning points than other indicators such as MACD For more info, read chapter 1 of Cybernetic Analysis for Stocks and Futures by John F. Ehlers We are implementing the latest version of this indicator found at Fig. 4 of http://www.mesasoftware.com/papers/UsingTheFisherTransform.pdf</li></ul></p><ul><li>Samples<br/>The Fisher transform is a mathematical process which is used to convert any data set to a modified data set whose Probability Distribution Function is approximately Gaussian.
