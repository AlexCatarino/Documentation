<p>The <code>CCI</code> method has the following properties:<br/><ul><li>MovingAverageType<br/>Gets the type of moving average</li></ul></p><ul><li>TypicalPriceAverage<br/>Keep track of the simple moving average of the typical price</li></ul></p><ul><li>TypicalPriceMeanDeviation<br/>Keep track of the mean absolute deviation of the typical price</li></ul></p><ul><li>IsReady<br/>Gets a flag indicating when this indicator is ready and fully initialized</li></ul></p><ul><li>WarmUpPeriod<br/>Required period, in data points, for the indicator to be ready and fully initialized.</li></ul></p><ul><li>Current<br/>Represents the traditional commodity channel index (CCI) CCI = (Typical Price - 20-period SMA of TP) / (.015 * Mean Deviation) Typical Price (TP) = (High + Low + Close)/3 Constant = 0.015 There are four steps to calculating the Mean Deviation, first, subtract the most recent 20-period average of the typical price from each period's typical price. Second, take the absolute values of these numbers. Third, sum the absolute values. Fourth, divide by the total number of periods (20).</li></ul></p><ul><li>Samples<br/>Represents the traditional commodity channel index (CCI) CCI = (Typical Price - 20-period SMA of TP) / (.015 * Mean Deviation) Typical Price (TP) = (High + Low + Close)/3 Constant = 0.015 There are four steps to calculating the Mean Deviation, first, subtract the most recent 20-period average of the typical price from each period's typical price.
