<p>The <code>TR</code> method has the following properties:<br/><ul><li>IsReady<br/>Gets a flag indicating when this indicator is ready and fully initialized</li></ul></p><ul><li>WarmUpPeriod<br/>Required period, in data points, for the indicator to be ready and fully initialized.</li></ul></p><ul><li>Current<br/>This indicator computes the True Range (TR). The True Range is the greatest of the following values: value1 = distance from today's high to today's low. value2 = distance from yesterday's close to today's high. value3 = distance from yesterday's close to today's low.</li></ul></p><ul><li>Samples<br/>This indicator computes the True Range (TR).
