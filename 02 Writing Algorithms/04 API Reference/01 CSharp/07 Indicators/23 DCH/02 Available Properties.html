<p>The <code>DCH</code> method has the following properties:<br/><ul><li>UpperBand<br/>Gets the upper band of the Donchian Channel.</li></ul></p><ul><li>LowerBand<br/>Gets the lower band of the Donchian Channel.</li></ul></p><ul><li>IsReady<br/>Gets a flag indicating when this indicator is ready and fully initialized</li></ul></p><ul><li>WarmUpPeriod<br/>Required period, in data points, for the indicator to be ready and fully initialized.</li></ul></p><ul><li>Current<br/>This indicator computes the upper and lower band of the Donchian Channel. The upper band is computed by finding the highest high over the given period. The lower band is computed by finding the lowest low over the given period. The primary output value of the indicator is the mean of the upper and lower band for the given timeframe.</li></ul></p><ul><li>Samples<br/>This indicator computes the upper and lower band of the Donchian Channel.
