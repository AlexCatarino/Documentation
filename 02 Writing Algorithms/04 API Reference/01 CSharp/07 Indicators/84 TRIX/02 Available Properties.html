<p>The <code>TRIX</code> method has the following properties:<br/><ul><li>IsReady<br/>Gets a flag indicating when this indicator is ready and fully initialized</li></ul></p><ul><li>WarmUpPeriod<br/>Required period, in data points, for the indicator to be ready and fully initialized. We have 3 EMAs chained on base period so every _period points starts the next EMA, hence -1 on the multiplication, and finally the last ema updates our _roc which needs to be warmed up before this indicator is warmed up.</li></ul></p><ul><li>Current<br/>This indicator computes the TRIX (1-period ROC of a Triple EMA) The TRIX is calculated as explained here: http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:trix</li></ul></p><ul><li>Samples<br/>This indicator computes the TRIX (1-period ROC of a Triple EMA) The TRIX is calculated as explained here: http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:trix</li></ul></p>
