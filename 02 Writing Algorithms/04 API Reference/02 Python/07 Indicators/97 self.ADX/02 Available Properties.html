<p>The <code>self.ADX</code> method has the following properties:<br/><ul><li>IsReady<br/>Gets a flag indicating when this indicator is ready and fully initialized</li></ul></p><ul><li>PositiveDirectionalIndex<br/>Gets the index of the Plus Directional Indicator</li></ul></p><ul><li>NegativeDirectionalIndex<br/>Gets the index of the Minus Directional Indicator</li></ul></p><ul><li>WarmUpPeriod<br/>Required period, in data points, for the indicator to be ready and fully initialized.</li></ul></p><ul><li>Current<br/>This indicator computes Average Directional Index which measures trend strength without regard to trend direction. Firstly, it calculates the Directional Movement and the True Range value, and then the values are accumulated and smoothed using a custom smoothing method proposed by Wilder. For an n period smoothing, 1/n of each period's value is added to the total period. From these accumulated values we are therefore able to derived the 'Positive Directional Index' (+DI) and 'Negative Directional Index' (-DI) which is used to calculate the Average Directional Index.
