<p>The <code>self.STO</code> method has the following properties:<br/><ul><li>FastStoch<br/>Gets the value of the Fast Stochastics %K given Period.</li></ul></p><ul><li>StochK<br/>Gets the value of the Slow Stochastics given Period K.</li></ul></p><ul><li>StochD<br/>Gets the value of the Slow Stochastics given Period D.</li></ul></p><ul><li>IsReady<br/>Gets a flag indicating when this indicator is ready and fully initialized</li></ul></p><ul><li>WarmUpPeriod<br/>Required period, in data points, for the indicator to be ready and fully initialized.</li></ul></p><ul><li>Current<br/>This indicator computes the Slow Stochastics %K and %D. The Fast Stochastics %K is is computed by (Current Close Price - Lowest Price of given Period) / (Highest Price of given Period - Lowest Price of given Period) multiplied by 100. Once the Fast Stochastics %K is calculated the Slow Stochastic %K is calculated by the average/smoothed price of of the Fast %K with the given period. The Slow Stochastics %D is then derived from the Slow Stochastics %K with the given period.</li></ul></p><ul><li>Samples<br/>This indicator computes the Slow Stochastics %K and %D.
