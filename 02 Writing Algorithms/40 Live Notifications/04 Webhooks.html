<p>Webhook notifications are an HTTP-POST request to a URL you provide. The request is sent with a timeout of 300s. You can process these notifications on your web server however you want. For instance, you can inject the content of the notifications into your server's database or use it to create other notifications on your own server. These notifications are rate-limited to 20 requests per hour. If you exceed the limit, each additional webhook notification costs 5 QCC.</p>

<p>To send webhook notifications in your code files, run:</p>
<div class="section-example-container">
    <pre class="csharp">Notify.Web(url, payload, headers);</pre>
    <pre class="python">self.Notify.Web(url, payload, headers)</pre>
</div>
