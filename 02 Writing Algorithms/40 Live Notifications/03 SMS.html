<p>SMS notifications are the only type of notification that you don't need an internet connection to receive. These notifications are rate-limited to 20 messages per hour. If you exceed the limit, each additional SMS notification costs 5 QCC.</p>

<p>To send SMS notifications in your code files, run:</p>
<div class="section-example-container">
    <pre class="csharp">Notify.Sms(phoneNumber, message);</pre>
    <pre class="python">self.Notify.Sms(phone_number, message)</pre>
</div>
