Using the the QuantBook history method <code>qb.History(Symbol[], Period, Resolution) </code> we can pass in an array of <code>Symbol</code> objects. It supports resolutions Minute, Hour and Daily. This can be easily done by passing in the <code>Securities</code> keys as demonstrated below:
</p>
<div class="section-example-container">
	<pre class="all"># Get historical data of last 10 days for all subscribed assets with time span
h1 = qb.History(qb.Securities.Keys, timedelta(days=10), Resolution.Daily)

# Get historical data of last 10 daily bars for specified symbol 
h2 = qb.History(["SPY"], 10, Resolution.Daily)
</pre>
</div>
<p>You can also use the start date and the end date to retrieve a period of history data with the method <code>qb.History(Symbols, StartDate, EndDate, Resolution)</code>. The format of start and end date are python datetime.
