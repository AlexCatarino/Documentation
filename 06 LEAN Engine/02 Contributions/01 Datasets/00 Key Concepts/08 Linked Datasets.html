<p>Your dataset is linked if any of the following statements are true:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Your dataset describes market price properties of specific securities (for example, the closing price of AAPL).</li>
    <li>Your alternative dataset is linked to individual securities (for example, the Wikipedia page view count of AAPL).</li>
</ul>

<p>Examples of unlinked datasets would be the weather of New York City, where data is not relevant to a specific security. </p>

<p>When a dataset is linked, it needs to be mapped to underlying assets through time. 
    The <code>RequiresMapping</code> boolean instructs LEAN to handle the security and ticker mapping issues.</p>
