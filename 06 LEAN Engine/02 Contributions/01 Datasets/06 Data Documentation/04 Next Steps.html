<p>After we review and accept your dataset contribution, we will create a page in our <a href='/datasets'>Dataset Market</a>. At that point, you will be able to write algorithms in QuantConnect Cloud using your dataset and you can contribute an example algorithm for the dataset listing. After your dataset listing is complete, we'll include your new dataset in our <a href='/docs/v2/lean-cli/datasets/downloading-data/download-by-ticker/key-concepts#02-Using-the-CLI'>downloading data tutorial</a>.</p>
