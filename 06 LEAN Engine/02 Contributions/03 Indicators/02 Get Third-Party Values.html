 As a quantitative algorithmic trading engine, accuracy and reliability are very important to LEAN. 
 When you submit a new indicator to the LEAN, you must include third-party source values are required as reference points in your pull request to contrast the values output by your indicator implementation. 
 This requirement validates that your indicator implementation is correct.
 The following sections explain some examples of acceptable third-party sources.
</p>

<h4>Renown Open-source Projects</h4>
<p>
 Developed and maintained by expert teams, these sources undergo rigorous testing and optimization, ensuring accurate calculations. 
 The transparent nature of open-source projects allows for community scrutiny, resulting in bug fixes and continuous improvements.
 Open-source projects provide thorough information on how the indicator values are calculated, which provides excellent reproducibility. 
 Thus, we accept values from these projects with high confidence. 
 Examples include the following open-source projects:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>TA-Lib</li>
    <li>QuantLib</li>
</ul>

<h4>Highly Credible Websites</h4>
<p>
 Similar reasons apply to these websites as well. 
 The site should be either the original source or a very popular trading data provider, such that we have confidence in their accuracy and reliability.
 These sources might provide structured data samples, like a <span class='public-file-name'>JSON</span> response, <span class='public-file-name'>CSV</span>/Excel file, or scripts for calculating the indicator values.
