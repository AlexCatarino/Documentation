  LEAN currently supports over 100 <a href='https://www.quantconnect.com/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/indicators/supported-indicators'>indicators</a>.
  This page explains how to contribute a new indicator to the open-source project by making a pull request to Lean. 
  Before you get started, familiarize yourself with our <a href='https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>contributing guidelines</a>.
  If you don't already have a new indicator in mind that you want to contribute, see <a href='https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aindicator' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>the GitHub Issues in the Lean repository</a> for a list of indicators that community members have requested.
