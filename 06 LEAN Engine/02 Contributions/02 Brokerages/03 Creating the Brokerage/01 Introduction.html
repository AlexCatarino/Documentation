<p>The <a rel='nofollow' target='_blank' href="https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean/blob/master/Common/Interfaces/IBrokerage.cs">IBrokerage</a> holds the bulk of the core logic responsible for running the brokerage implementation. Many smaller models described later internally use the brokerage implementation, so its best to now start implementating the <code>IBrokerage</code>. Brokerage classes can get quite large, so use a <code>partial</code> class modifier to break up the files in appropriate categories.</p>
