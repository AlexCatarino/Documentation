<p>Your data source class should read <span class="public-file-name">CSV</span> files. Bundle dates together where possible to speed up execution. Just ensure the data in the file is in chronological order. You should package your data to avoid reading data outside the algorithm date range. For example, if your dataset provides minute-resolution data for a security, it should bundle the data by date (for example, <span class="public-file-name">/ &nbsp; alternative &nbsp; / &nbsp; &lt;vendorName&gt; &nbsp; / &nbsp; &lt;datasetName&gt; &nbsp; / &nbsp; minute &nbsp; / &nbsp; aapl &nbsp; / &nbsp; 20200202.csv</span>).</p>
