<p>Most brokerages provide a wrapper for their API. If it has a permissive license and it's compatible with .NET 6, you should utilize it. Although it is technically possible to embed an external github repository, we've elected to not do this to make LEAN easier to install (submodules can be tricky for beginners). Instead, copy the library into its own subfolder of the brokerage implementation. For example, <span class="public-file-name">Lean.Brokerages.&lt;brokerageName&gt; / QuantConnect.&lt;brokerageName&gt;Brokerage / BrokerLib / *</span>. After you add a library, build the project again to make sure the library successfully compiles.</p>
