<p>The brokerage has many the following important roles vital for the stability of a running algorithm:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Maintain Connection - Connect and maintain connection while algorithm running.</li>
	<li>Setup State - Initialize the algorithm portfolio, open orders and cashbook.</li>
	<li>Order Operations - Create, update and cancel orders.</li>
	<li>Order Events - Receive order fills and apply them to portfolio.</li>
	<li>Account Events - Track non-order events (cash deposits/removals).</li>
	<li>Brokerage Events - Interpret brokerage messages and act when required.</li>
	<li>Serve History Requests - Provide historical data on request.</li> 
</ol> 

<p>Brokerages often have their own ticker styles, order class names, and event names. Many of the methods in the brokerage implementation may simply be converting from the brokerage object format into LEAN format. You should plan accordingly to write neat code.</p>

<p>The brokerage must implement the following interfaces:</p>
<div class="section-example-container">	
	<pre class="csharp"><pre>class MyBrokerage : Brokerage, IDataQueueHandler, IDataQueueUniverseProvider { ... }</pre>
