<p>This guide focuses on implementing the brokerage step-by-step in LEAN because it's a more natural workflow for most people. You can also follow a more test-driven development process by following the test harness. To do this, create a new test class that extends from the base class in <span class='public-file-name'>Lean &nbsp; / &nbsp; Tests &nbsp; / &nbsp; Brokerages &nbsp; / &nbsp; BrokerageTests.cs</span>. This test-framework tests all the methods for an <code>IBrokerage</code> implementation.</p>
