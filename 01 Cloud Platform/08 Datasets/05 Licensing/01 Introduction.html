<p>You can license datasets in the Dataset Market to use in the cloud for live trading and research or to download locally. We have contracts with the data providers in the Dataset Market that define the costs of each license. All of the datasets can be used in QC Cloud. There are some free licenses, but we can't freely redistribute most of the datasets.</p>
