<p>Bybit supports cash and margin accounts. To set the account type in an algorithm, see the <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/reality-modeling/brokerages/supported-models/bybit'>Bybit brokerage model documentation</a>.</p>

<h4>Create an Account</h4>
<p>Follow the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.bybit.com/en/help-center/article/How-to-register-an-account">How to Register an Account</a> tutorial on the Bybit website to create a Bybit account.</p>

<p>You will need API credentials to deploy live algorithms. After you have an account, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.bybit.com/en/help-center/article/How-to-create-your-API-key">create API credentials</a> and store them somewhere safe. As you create credentials, make the following configurations:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Under API Key Usage, select <span class="box-name">API Transaction</span></li>
    <li>Choose a name for the API key</li>
    <li>Under API Key Permissions, select <span class="box-name">Read-Write</span></li>
    <li>Select the <span class="box-name">Only IPs with permissions granted are allowed to access the OpenAPI</span> radio button and then enter our IP address, 146.59.85.21.</li>
    <li>Select the <span class="box-name">Unified Trading</span> check box. This selection gives read-write permissions to the following queries:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Order.</li>
        <li>Positions.</li>
        <li>Trade.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<h4>Paper Trading</h4>
<p>Our integration doesn't support paper trading through the Bybit Demo Trading environment, but you can follow these steps to simulate it:</p>

<ol>
    <li>In the <code class="csharp">Initialize</code><code class="python">initialize</code> method of your algorithm, set the Bybit brokerage model.</li>
