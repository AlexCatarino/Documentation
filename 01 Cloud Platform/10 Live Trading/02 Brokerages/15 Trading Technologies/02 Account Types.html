<p>The <code>TradingTechnologiesBrokerageModel</code> does not have specific modeling for fees and slippage because TT is an order router and can execute on many exchanges and brokerages. To set the brokerage model and account type in an algorithm, see the <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/reality-modeling/brokerages/supported-models/trading-technologies'>TT brokerage model documentation</a>. In live trading, TT reports the total fees of your orders after each order fill. Pass a different <code>BrokerageName</code> to <code class="csharp">SetBrokerageModel</code><code class="python">set_brokerage_model</code> to backtest your algorithm with fee and slippage modeling. The brokerage model you set should support the asset classes and orders in your algorithm.</p>
