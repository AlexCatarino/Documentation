  When you have a strategy that shows promising backtest results, consider paper trading the strategy before deploying it with real money.
  Many of our <a href='/docs/v2/cloud-platform/live-trading/brokerages'>brokerage integrations</a> support a demo environment for paper trading.
  If your brokerage supports a demo live environment, deploy a live algorithm that uses it. 
  Otherwise, <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/reality-modeling/brokerages/key-concepts#02-Set-Models'>set the brokerage model</a> to your brokerage and then <a href='/docs/v2/cloud-platform/live-trading/brokerages/quantconnect-paper-trading#14-Deploy-Live-Algorithms'>deploy your algorithm with the QuantConnect Paper Trading brokerage</a>.
  The demo environment and reality model of your brokerage provide the most accurate results for live trading.
</p>

<p>
  During the paper trading stage, perform the following stress tests to ensure your algorithm can handle interference:  
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Restart your algorithm when the market is open and closed.</li>
  <li><a href='/docs/v2/cloud-platform/live-trading/algorithm-control#06-Update-the-Algorithm'>Update and redeploy the algorithm</a>.</li>
  <li><a href='/docs/v2/cloud-platform/projects/getting-started#05-Clone-Projects'>Clone the project</a> and deploy the cloned version.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  If the preceding stress tests pass, load a small amount of money into your real money brokerage account for final validation.
  When you're ready to transition to live trading, load the rest of your trading capital into the account that you already validated.
