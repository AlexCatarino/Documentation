<p>Set up some live trading notifications so that you are notified of market events and your algorithm's performance. We support email, SMS, webhooks, and Telegram notifications. If you set up notifications in the deployment wizard, we will notify you when your algorithm places orders or emits insights. To be notified at other moments in your algorithm, <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/live-trading/notifications'>create notifications in your code files</a> with the <code>NotificationManager</code>. Lean ignores notifications during backtests. To view the number of notification you can send for free, see the <a href='/docs/v2/cloud-platform/organizations/resources#13-Live-Trading-Notification-Quotas'>Live Trading Notification Quotas</a>.</p>
