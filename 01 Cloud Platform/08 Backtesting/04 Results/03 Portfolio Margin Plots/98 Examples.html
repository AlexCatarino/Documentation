<p>The following examples provide insight into portfolio margin calculations and show the functionality of the portfolio margin chart.</p>

<h4>Buying Put Options</h4>
<p>
  <a href='https://www.quantconnect.com/terminal/processCache?request=embedded_backtest_06f007bbbc375e2224197986192b7ae9.html'>This algorithm</a> demonstrates that when you buy a put Option contract and you long the underlying asset, it reduces the margin used by the underlying asset.
  In the following image, the gray area represents the underlying Equity and the blue area represents the put Option contract.
  The algorithm buys SPY on 10/07/2013, buys the put Option contract on 01/02/2014, and then exercises the contract on 06/21/2014.

<h4>Buying Futures</h4>
<p>
  <a href='https://www.quantconnect.com/terminal/processCache?request=embedded_backtest_bf7e791cddd577318ad3c9fc7f611348.html'>This algorithm</a> demonstrates that Futures have a fixed, USD-denominated margin requirement.
  In the following image, the blue area represents the percentage of the available margin that the Futures contract uses.
  The algorithm buys the contract on 10/02/2023 and holds it until the end of the backtest.
  As the total portfolio value decreases during the last two week in the backtest, the amount of available margin in the portfolio decreases. 
  However, the USD amount of margin used by the Futures contract is constant, so the proportion of portfolio margin used by the contract increases at the same time.

<h4>Buying Forex</h4>
<p>
  <a href='https://www.quantconnect.com/terminal/processCache?request=embedded_backtest_e51e7cfbee8e474273e3ba14035aa697.html'>This algorithm</a> demonstrates that Forex has 50x leverage available.
  In the following image, the blue area represents the percentage of the available margin that the Forex position uses.
  The algorithm buys 500% exposure to the EURUSD pair on 01/02/2018 and holds it until the end of the backtest.
  The portfolio margin chart shows that only 10% of the available margin is used to enter the trade since 500% / 50 = 10%.
