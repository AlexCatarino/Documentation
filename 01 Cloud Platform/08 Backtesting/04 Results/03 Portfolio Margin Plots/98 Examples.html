<p>The following examples provide insight into portfolio margin calculations and demonstrate the functionality of the portfolio margin chart.</p>

<h4>Buying Put Options</h4>

  <a href='https://www.quantconnect.com/terminal/processCache?request=embedded_backtest_06f007bbbc375e2224197986192b7ae9.html'>This algorithm</a> demonstrates that if you buy an asset and then buy a put Option contract on the asset, it reduce the margin that the underlying asset consumes.
  In the following image, the gray area represents the underlying Equity and the blue area represents the put Option contract.
  The algorithm buys SPY on 10/07/2013, buys the put Option contract on 01/02/2014, and then exercises the contract on 06/21/2014.

<h4>Buying Futures</h4>
<p>
  <a href='https://www.quantconnect.com/terminal/processCache?request=embedded_backtest_bf7e791cddd577318ad3c9fc7f611348.html'>This algorithm</a> demonstrates that Futures have a fixed margin requirement, denominated in USD. 
  In the following image, the blue area represents the percentage of the available margin that the Futures contract consumed.
  The algorithm buys the contract on 10/02/2023 and holds it until the end of the backtest.
  As the total portfolio value decreases during the last two week in the backtest, it decreases the amount of available margin in the portfolio. 
  However, the USD amount of margin used by the Futures contract is constant, so the proportion of portfolio margin used by the contract increases at the same time.
