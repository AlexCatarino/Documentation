  When you trade with a margin account, orders consume your cash before borrowing anything on margin.
  This order of precedence minimizes the interest charges on your margin loans.
  For example, <a href='https://www.quantconnect.com/terminal/processCache?request=embedded_backtest_4984367246db7266e3b4c07d82ce5986.html'>this algorithm</a> starts with $100K USD.
  It buys $99,384 worth of SPY shares and the logs show that there is $486.92 remaining after the order fills.
  The total margin used is ~$50K becuase there is 2x leverage available.
