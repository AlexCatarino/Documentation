<p>
  The series names in the chart are the last known tickers for the respective assets (for example, SPY and XLE). 
  Therefore, if you trade multiple assets throughout a backtest that share the same last known ticker (for example, FB in 1998 and FB in 2014), the chart labels them under the same series name.
