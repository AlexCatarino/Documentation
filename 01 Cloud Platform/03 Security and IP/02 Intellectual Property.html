<p>The following sections explain our commitment to protecting your intellectual property.</p>

<h4>Ownership</h4>
<p>You own all your intellectual property and your code. Your code is private by default unless you explicitly share it with the community in the forums or with another team member via collaboration. You are creating valuable intellectual property; we respect this and wish to make it easier. We document this publicly in our Terms of Service.</p>

<h4>Alignment</h4>
<p>Beyond words and our legal terms of service, we live this through the alignment of our business model with you, our clients. We aim for you to become more successful, thereby growing within our ecosystem. We've served start-up quant funds as they've grown from $0 to $1B+ AUM.</p>

<h4>Reputation and Track Record</h4>
<p>Established in 2012, we have a pristine reputation and a 10+ year record of protecting our community's intellectual property. We have served more than 200,000 clients. If we were to violate the trust of even a single client, we'd lose the entire community's faith - it is simply not worth it. We seek to change the future of finance and are driven by this mission.</p>

<h4>Sharing</h4>
<p>
QuantConnect provides support with a specific support agent, not an anonymous team. When submitting a support ticket, you explicitly grant that team member access to your project. You can remove the support agent from your project collaboration at any time.
