  Payment For Order Flow (PFOF) ocurrs when a firm receives compensation from market makers or trading venues for directing client orders to them for execution.
  We have never taken PFOF or shared in trading flows.
  Instead, our business model is centered on providing the best infrastructure for quant trading, which simply routes orders directly to your brokerage for execution.
