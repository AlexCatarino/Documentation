<p>To reduce the chance of overfitting, organization managers can enforce all backtests must end a certain number of months before the current date.

A hold out period is helpful because it leaves you an out-of-sample period to test your model after your done the development stage. To change the backtest hold out period, <a href='/docs/v2/cloud-platform/organizations/administration#05-View-the-Organization-Homepage'>open the organization homepage</a> and then scroll down to the <span class='page-section-name'>Backtesting Out of Sample Period</span> section and enter the out-of-sample period duration.</p>
