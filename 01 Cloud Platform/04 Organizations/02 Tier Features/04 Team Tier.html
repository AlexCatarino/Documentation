<p>The Team tier is designed for sophisticated individuals and teams of quant collaborators such as Quant Start Ups, Fintech Companies, and Emerging Managers. We recommend the Team Pack to make the most of QuantConnect.</p>

<p>The Team tier expands on the features included in the Quant Researcher tier. Organizations on the Team tier can have up to 10 members and the members can collaborate on projects together. These organizations can produce 1MB of logs/backtest, 10MB of logs/day, and there is no limit on the number of orders that they can place in backtests. Organizations on the Team tier can have up to 10 backtesting nodes, 10 research nodes, and 10 live trading nodes. Members in these organizations can have up to four active coding sessions in the organization.</p>

<p>To accommodate a large number of projects in Team organizations, these organizations can expand the capacity of their Object Store up to 10GB. Annual contracts for onboarding services are available on request to get teams operational in the shortest amount of time. When live trading, Team organizations have more options than the lower tiers because both the <a href="/docs/v2/cloud-platform/live-trading/brokerages/trading-technologies">Trading Technologies brokerage</a> and our <a href="/docs/v2/cloud-platform/live-trading/data-providers/quantconnect/futures">live Futures data provider</a> are available. Each live algorithm in a Team organization can send up to 60 Telegram, Email, or Webhook notifications per hour for free.</p>
