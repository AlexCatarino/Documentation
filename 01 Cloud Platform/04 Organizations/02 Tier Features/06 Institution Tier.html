<p>The Institution tier is designed for established larger funds, large prop desks, hedge funds, banks, ETF vehicles, and professional teams of quants. It is "unlocked", so you can run it on premise to serve your internal teams. If this sounds interesting, <a href="/appointments">reach out</a> and we'd be happy to arrange a demonstration for your department.
</p>

<p>The Institution tier builds on the features included in the Trading Firm tier. Organizations on the institutional tier have no limit on the number of backtest logs that they can produce, and each member of the organization can have up to 16 active coding sessions. These organizations can use <a href="/docs/v2/cloud-platform/live-trading/brokerages/bloomberg-emsx">Terminal Link</a> to live trade Equities, Futures, and Options via the Bloomberg EMSX. They can also request <a href="/docs/v2/cloud-platform/projects/package-environments#99-Request-New-Libraries">custom libraries and frameworks</a> to use in the QuantConnect web IDE and receive instant messaging support from a QuantConnect engineer. Each live algorithm in an Institution organization can send up to 3,600 Telegram, Email, or Webhook notifications per hour for free.</p>

<p>Institutional clients can run our proprietary build of LEAN, LEAN Enterprise, on-premise. LEAN Enterprise holds speed improvements we haven't pushed to the open-source.</p>
