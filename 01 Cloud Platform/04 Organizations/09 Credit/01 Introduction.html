<p>We created QuantConnect Credit (QCC) to enable micropayments on QuantConnect. You can use QCC to optimize parameters, download datasets, and gift to members in the forum. You can purchase QCC in the Algorithm Lab at a rate of 1 QCC = $0.01 USD. Since QCC is owned by organizations instead of members, all of the members within your organization have the ability to spend the QCC balance.</p>
