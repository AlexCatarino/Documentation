<p>The following table shows the number of AI tickets each seat tier can open during a calendar month:</p>

<table class="table qc-table" id="seat-quota-table">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th style="width: 50%;">Tier</th>
            <th>Open Ticket Quota</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Gold</td>
            <td>250</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Silver</td>
            <td>125</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Bronze</td>
            <td>25</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<style>
#seat-quota-table th:not(:first-child),
#seat-quota-table td:not(:first-child) {
    text-align: right;
}
</style>


<p>The quotas don't restore on the first day of the month or the billing date. They restore according to a 1-month rolling window.</p>
