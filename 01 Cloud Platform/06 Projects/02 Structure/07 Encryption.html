  When you save projects in QuantConnect Cloud, you can save encrypted versions of your project files instead of the raw, human readable, file content. 
  Encrypting your projects gives you an additional layer of protection.
  To use the encryption system, you provide your own encryption key, which your local browser saves to memory. 
  Afterwards, whenever you save your project, your browser uses the local key to encrypt your project files and then only the obfuscated files are pushed to QuantConnect Cloud.
