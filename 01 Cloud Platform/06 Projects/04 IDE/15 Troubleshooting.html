<p>If you experience issues trying to load the IDE, follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Check if you're using one of the <a href="/docs/v2/cloud-platform/projects/ide#13-Supported-Browsers">supported browsers</a>.</li>
    <li>Test a different supported browser.</li>
    <li><a href="/docs/v2/cloud-platform/projects/ide#14-Cookies">Enable cookies</a>.</li>
    <li>Disable your browser add-ons.</li>
    <li>Check your anti-virus settings.</li>
    <p>The internet protection of some anti-virus products block the "Service Workers" that the IDE needs to operate. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.kaspersky.com">Kaspersky</a> and <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.austintexas.gov/faq/how-do-i-stop-avast-antivirus-blocking-your-website-andor-webforms">Avast</a> are the two products that commonly block the IDE from using Service Workers. These are background threads that improve the IDE's experience.</p>
    <li>Configure your network settings to use <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/docs/using">Google Public DNS</a>.</li>
    <p>The DNS settings of some ISPs block Microsoft DNS, so some panels don't load and display the following message: "Server IP address could not be found".</p>
    <p>The following resources explain how to change your networks settings:</p>
    <ul>

    </ul>
    <li>Check your internet connection and speed.</li>
    <li>Try to load the IDE with a different computer, tablet, or cell phone.</li>
    <li>Clear your browser cache, especially if you created your project before the new IDE (March 2022).</li> 
    <p>Your browser may cache data from the old IDE.</p>
</ol>
