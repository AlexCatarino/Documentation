    Cookies are essential for the Algorithm Lab to connect to the VS Code environment because modern browsers treat the coding environment domain (e.g., {...}.code.qc.com) as a third-party domain relative to the main domain (www.qc.com). 
    This distinction means that if cookies for the coding environment are blocked, essential functions like user authentication, passing messages, adjusting panel sizes, setting tasks in bootcamp, and <a href='https://www.quantconnect.com/docs/v2/cloud-platform/projects/encryption'>encrypting/decrypting project files</a> will not work correctly, leading to a disrupted user experience. 
    Enabling cookies ensures that your coding session remains seamless and fully functional.
