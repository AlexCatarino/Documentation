  When you save projects in QuantConnect Cloud, you can save encrypted versions of your project files instead of the raw, human readable, file content. 
  Encrypting your projects gives you an additional layer of protection.
  To use the encryption system, you provide your own encryption key, which your local browser saves to memory. 
  For more information about project encryption, see <a href='/docs/v2/cloud-platform/projects/encryption'>Encryption</a>.
