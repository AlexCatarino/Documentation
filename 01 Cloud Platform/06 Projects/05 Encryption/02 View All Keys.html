<p>The <img class='inline-icon' src='https://cdn.quantconnect.com/i/tu/encryption-missing-icon.png'> icon means the key is registered in the database but we could not locate it on your computer. To use this key, click <span class='button-name'>Use Key</span> and upload the key to the view. This process stores a copy of your key in the local store so you can decrypt the relevant projects in your organization.</p>
