<p>
Encrypted projects can use <a href='/docs/v2/cloud-platform/projects/shared-libraries'>libraries</a> encrypted with the same project key or unencrypted libraries. However, you cannot use a library encrypted with a different project encryption key. 
</p>

<p>
To encrypt a library, <a href='/docs/v2/cloud-platform/projects/getting-started#02-View-All-Projects'>open its project</a> and <a href='/docs/v2/cloud-platform/projects/encryption#05-Add-Encryption'>set its encryption key</a>.
