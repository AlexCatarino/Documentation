<p>To check if you have completed a task correctly, backtest your algorithm in the Learning Center environment and then the result window displays your results. If you receive an error message, update the code and then run the backtest again. If you pass the task, you'll be prompted to proceed to the next task in the course. If you're having trouble completing the task, you can copy the task solution file.</p>
