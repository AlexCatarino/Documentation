This download is for the licensed organization's internal LEAN use only and cannot be redistributed or converted in any format. If you study the data and produce some charts, you may share images of the charts online if the original data can't be to reconstructed from the image. The cost of the license depends on the dataset and it's calculated on a per-file or per-day basis.
