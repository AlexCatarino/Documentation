<p>
  When you <a href='/docs/v2/cloud-platform/live-trading/brokerages/interactive-brokers#16-Deploy-Live-Algorithms'>deploy a live algorithm with the IB brokerage</a>, you can use the QC data provider, the IB data provider, or both. 
  If you use multiple data providers, the order you select them in defines their order of precedence in Lean.
  For example, if you set QC as the first provider and IB as the second provider, Lean only uses the IB data provider for securities that aren't available from the QC data provider.
  This configuration makes it possible to use our data provider for Equity universe selection and then place Options trades on the securities in the universe. 
  If you use the QC data provider, the assets that you subscribe to don't contribute to the <a href='/docs/v2/cloud-platform/datasets/interactive-brokers#03-Universe-Selection'>IB data limit</a>.
