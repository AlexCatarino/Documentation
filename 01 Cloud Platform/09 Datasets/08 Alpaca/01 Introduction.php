<p>
  The Alpaca data feeds are streams of Equity, Equity Option and Crypto prices directly from <a rel='nofollow' target='_blank' href='https://docs.alpaca.markets/docs/about-market-data-api'>Alpaca's Market Data API</a>. 
  Just note that our integration supports a subset of data that their API can deliver.
