Our Dataset Market is a portal where we aggregate datasets for you to use in your algorithms. Our Dataset Market includes price, fundamental, and alternative datasets. Consider using fundamental and alternative datasets to incorporate more information in your trading decisions. Fundamental and alternative datasets contain information that is not present in the price. Price data is commonly researched for trading ideas, so you may find it easier to discover alpha in other types of datasets.</p><p>The Dataset Market enables you to easily load datasets into your trading algorithms for use in the cloud or locally. The datasets come configured ready to integrate into your research and backtesting without any need for cleaning. The datasets in our market are vetted by the QuantConnect team to be high-quality, contain actionable information, and be free of survivorship-bias. Our Dataset Market is growing quickly. New datasets are added frequently.</p>",
