<p>When you <a href='/docs/v2/cloud-platform/live-trading/brokerages/interactive-brokers#16-Deploy-Live-Algorithms'>deploy a live algorithm with the IB brokerage</a>, you can use the QC data provider, the IB data provider, or both. If you use both data providers, Lean gives priority to the QuantConnect data provider. If our data provider doesn't have a stream for the securities you request, Lean uses the IB data provider. This process makes it possible to use our data provider for Equity universe selection and then place Options trades on the securities in the universe. If you use the QC data provider, the assets that you subscribe to don't contribute to the <a href='/docs/v2/cloud-platform/datasets/interactive-brokers#03-Universe-Selection'>IB data limit</a>.</p>
