<p>The delivery schedule of alternative data depends on the specific dataset you're using. We inject the data into your algorithms when the vendor provides the data. For most alternative datasets, the data is updated on a daily or hourly basis. Some datasets, like the <a href='/datasets/tiingo-news-feed'>Tiingo News Feed</a> or <a href='/datasets/benzinga-news-feed'>Benzinga News Feed</a>, include a live stream. In these cases, we deliver the data as a live stream to your algorithm.</p>

<p>Live data takes time to travel from the source to your algorithm. The latency of the alternative data depends on the specific dataset you're using.</p>
