<p>Some data issues are reported that aren't actually data issues. Instead, they are from a misunderstanding of how the data is collected, timestamped, formatted, and normalized. These misunderstandings are caused by assumptions that the data should be the same across different platforms, should have the same timezones, should be timestamped a certain way, and should be normalized the same as other data sources.</p>
