<p>By default, LEAN adjusts US Equity data for splits and dividends to produce a smooth price curve. We use the entire split and dividend history to adjust historical prices. This process ensures you get the same adjusted prices, regardless of the backtest end date.</p>

<p>Backtest differences occur when you run backtests before a split or diviend occurs in live trading and then run the same backtest after it occurs, since the adjusted prices will be different. The difference can be significant in large universes because of multiple corporate actions and the cummulative effect of orders with a small difference.</p>
