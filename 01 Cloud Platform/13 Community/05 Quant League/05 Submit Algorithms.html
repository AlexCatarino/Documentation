<p>Before you submit an algorithm, ensure your team abides by the following rules:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Your team's algorithm should be unique. Organizations are penalized for submitting algorithms that are nearly identical to other clubs.</li>
  <li>Team members must use their real names on their QuantConnect profile. To change your name, see <a href='/docs/v2/cloud-platform/community/profile#02-Personal-Information'>Personal Information</a>.</li>
</ul>

</p>

  To submit an algorithm, click the "Enter Competition" button at the top of the page and send a message to support describing your team and university.
  At the end of the competition, your algorithm will automatically be resubmitted for the competition in each following quarter.
