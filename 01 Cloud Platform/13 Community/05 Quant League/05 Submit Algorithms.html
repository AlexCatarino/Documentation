<p>Before you submit an algorithm, you must successfully <a href="/docs/v2/cloud-platform/backtesting">backtest it</a>. Your algorithm must observe the following rules:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Your algorithm is unique. Teams are penalized for submitting algorithms that are nearly identical to other competitors.</li>
  <li>Your algorithm trades liquid <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/securities/key-concepts">securities</a>. For Equities, this includes the top 1000 stocks, Crypto includes the top 10 coins, Forex includes the top 20 pairs, and Futures includes the top 30 contracts.</li>
  <li>The maximum leverage is 2.</li>
</ul>

<p>Follow these steps to submit your team's algorithm:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href='/login'>Log in to your account</a>.</li>
  <li>On the <a href='/league'>Open Quant League</a> page, scroll down to find your team's submission, and click <span class="button-name">View</span>.</li>
