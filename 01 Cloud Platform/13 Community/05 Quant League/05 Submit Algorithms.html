<p>Before you submit an algorithm, you must <a href="/docs/v2/cloud-platform/backtesting">run a backtest</a> successfully. Your algorithm must observe the following rules:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Your algorithm is unique. Teams are penalized for submitting algorithms that are nearly identical to other competitors.</li>
  <li>Your algorithm trades liquid <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/securities/key-concepts">securities</a>. For equities, this includes the top 1000 stocks, crypto top 10 coins, forex top 20 pairs, and futures the top 30 contracts.</li>
  <li>The maximum leverage is 2.</li>
</ul>

<p>Follow these steps to submit your team's algorithm:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Log in to your account.</li>
  <li>Open the <a href='/league'>page</a>.</li>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>In the top navigation bar, click <span class="button-name">Research</span>.</li>
    <li>Click on <span class="button-name">League</span> tab.</li>
