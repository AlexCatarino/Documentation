<p>Before you submit an algorithm, ensure your team abides by the following rules:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Your team's algorithm should be unique. Organizations are penalized for submitting algorithms that are nearly identical to other clubs.</li>
  <li>Team members must use their real names on their QuantConnect profile, and a link to their LinkedIn page. To change your name and set a LinkedIn profile, see <a href='/docs/v2/cloud-platform/community/profile#02-Personal-Information'>Personal Information</a>.</li>
  <li>The asset universes should have sufficient liquidity for reasonable trading. For equities, this includes the top 1000 stocks, crypto top 10 coins, forex top 20 pairs, and futures the top 30 contracts.</li>
  <li>Algorithms should use 2x leverage maximum.</li>
</ul> 
</p>

  Once you have an initial submission ready, click <span class='button-name'>Enter Competition</span> at the top of the page and send a message to support describing your team and university.
