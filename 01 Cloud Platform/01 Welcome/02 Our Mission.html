Quantitative trading infrastructure should be open-source. Millions of financial engineers rewrite the same infrastructure, and their work is kept closed to make it harder for competing trading firms. We are taking a radically open approach to quant finance and letting our users focus on alpha, not infrastructure.
</p>
<p>
The future of finance is automated, and we are the open-source infrastructure to power this future. Firms choose our open-source platform as it provides a 10-100x improvement in time to market and substantially reduces the risk of developing your quantitative tools. As our brokerage and data integrations expand, this leverage will be more exceptional.

<p>
Everyone should have access to quantitative finance. Algorithmic trading is a powerful tool, and we want to open it up to all investors. We do this with transparent, scalable pricing that allows all investors to access quantitative finance. For more information on our mission, check out our <a href="/about#manifesto">Manifesto</a>.
