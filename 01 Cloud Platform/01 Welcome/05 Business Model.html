QuantConnect provides cloud infrastructure as a service, similar to many cloud compute vendors. We want to encourage quants and start up firms to grow within our ecosystem so keep our pricing accessible to individuals and small firms.

For companies interested in running QuantConnect on-premise we can install it within your corporate firewall and help you get setup with financial data. We charge a setup and maintenance fee for these installations.
