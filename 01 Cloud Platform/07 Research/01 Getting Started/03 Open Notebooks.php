<p>When you open a notebook, it automatically tries to connect to the correct Jupyter server and select the correct kernel, which can take up to one minute. If the top-right corner of the notebook displays a <span class='button-name'>base (Python x.x.x)</span> button, wait for the button to change to <span class='csharp button-name'>Foundation-C#-Default</span><span class='python button-name'>Foundation-Py-Default</span> before you run the cells.</p>
