<p>The cloud optimizer can optimize up to three parameters. There are several reasons for this quota. First, the optimizer only supports the <a href="/docs/v2/cloud-platform/optimization/strategies">grid search strategy</a>, which is very inefficient. This strategy tests every permutation of parameter values, so the number of backtests that the optimization job must run explodes as you add more parameters. Second, the <a href="/docs/v2/cloud-platform/optimization/results#05-Parameter-Charts">parameter charts</a> that display the optimization results are limited to three dimensions. Third, if you optimize with many variables, it increases the likelihood of <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/parameters#04-Overfitting">overfitting</a> to historical data.</p>

<p>To optimize more than three parameters, <a href="/docs/v2/lean-cli/optimization/deployment#02-Run-Local-Optimizations">run local optimizations with the CLI</a>.</p>
