<p>
  The MCP integration supports multiple workflows, ranging from exclusively using the LLM for everything all the way to just prompting the LLM to supplement your activity on our other platforms. 
  The following sections contain several examples of common workflows.
</p>

<h4>LLM-Focused Workflow</h4>

<p>An LLM-focused workflow might look like this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open Docker Desktop and your MCP client application.</li>
  <li>Issue prompts to investigate new trading ideas, create projects, run backtests, analyze backtest performance, and manage live algorithms.</li>
  <li>When you’re finished, shut down the client and Docker Desktop.</li>
</ol>

<p>
  The advantage of this workflow is it doesn’t require you to be an expert in programming or financial markets. 
  It leverages the knowledge of the pre-trained LLM to fill your knowledge gaps. 
  The downside to this workflow is LLMs aren’t perfect, so you may need to intervene if it starts hallucinating or if it struggles to implement sophisticated trading logic. 
</p>

<h4>Multi-Platform Workflow</h4>

<p>A multi-platform workflow might look like this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open Cloud Platform, Docker Desktop, and your MCP client application.</li>
  <li>Create a new project in the Algorithm Lab and run a backtest.</li>
  <li>Close the project in the Algorithm Lab to avoid saving conflicts in the next step.</li>
  <li>Prompt the client application to add a trailing stop order to the project.</li>
  <li>Re-open the project in the Algorithm Lab and inspect the updated project file.</li>
  <li>Deploy an optimization in the Algorithm Lab.</li>
  <li>Prompt the client application to interpret the optimization results and offer suggestions for improvement.</li>
  <li>When you’re finished, close the Cloud Platform, client application, and Docker Desktop.</li>
</ol>

<p>
  The advantage of this workflow is you can continue using the Cloud Platform, Local Platform, and CLI as you usually would while leveraging the power of LLMs to perform tedious tasks and brainstorm solutions. 
  The downside to this workflow is you need to close the project on the Algorithm Lab when you prompt the LLM to update the contents of a file in the project. 
  For more information about these saving conflicts, see the following section on <span class='page-section-name'>Troubleshooting</span>.
