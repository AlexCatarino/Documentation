<p>The following sections explain some issues you may encounter and how to resolve them.</p>

<h4>No Tools Available</h4>
<p>
  When you open your MCP client, it can take up to 30 seconds for the MCP server to start up and for the client to connect to it. 
  Before you start entering prompts, check Docker Desktop to ensure the container is running and check the client to ensure it’s connected. 
  For example, in Claude Desktop, you can click Search and tools and see the QuantConnect tools are available.
</p>

<p>If the client can’t discover the tools after 30 seconds, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Shut down the client application.</li>
  <p>For example, in Claude Desktop, click <span class='button-name'>File > Exit</span>.</p>
  
  <li>If the server doesn’t automatically shut down in Docker Desktop, click the trash icon to shut it down.</li>
  <img class='docs-image' src='' alt='Docker Desktop container page showing the MCP server is still running.'>
  
  <li>Restart the client application.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Service Outages</h4>
<p>
  The MCP server relies on the QuantConnect API and the client application. 
  To check the status of the QuantConnect API, see our <a href='https://status.quantconnect.com/'>Status</a> page. 
  To check the status of your client and the LLM, see their status page. 
  Claude Desktop users can use the <a href='https://status.anthropic.com/'>Anthropic Status</a> page.
</p>

<h4>File Updates Are Reverted</h4>
<p>
  The Algorithm Lab regularly saves the files of the project you have open. 
  If you ask the LLM to update a file in a project while you also have the same project open in the Algorithm Lab, the LLM will update the file and then the Algorithm Lab will overwrite it with the current file that’s open. 
  To avoid issues, don’t prompt the LLM to save a file to a project that you have open in the Algorithm Lab.
