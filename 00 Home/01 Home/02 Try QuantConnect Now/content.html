    QuantConnect's LEAN engine manages your portfolio and data feeds letting you focus on your algorithm strategy and
    execution. Data is piped into your strategy via event handlers, upon which you can place trades. We provide basic
    portfolio management and fill modelling underneath the hood automatically. This is provided by the QCAlgorithm base
    class.
