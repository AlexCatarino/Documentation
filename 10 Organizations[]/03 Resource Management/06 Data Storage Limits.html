The Object Store <See Docs> allows you to store project specific data in QuantConnect’s cache. This can be useful in saving machine learning models or other data which is expensive to compute or retrieve from external sources. Free accounts receive a storage space of 500 Mb in the object store. However, you can add additional storage space up to 10 Gb of space. You can also view how much storage space you’ve consumed so far.
