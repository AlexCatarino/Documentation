QuantConnect is built around organizations. The organizations feature gives individuals and businesses the power to scale their systems in quantconnect. Every individual account is a member of at least one organization. A default personal organization is created for every account, but you can also create new organizations or join existing ones.  Multiple users can belong to an organization, and share resources for backtesting and live trading.

With the organizations feature, comes the ability to subscribe to more resources as needed. Many of the free features previously available for individual accounts are still available, however the payment structure for additional resources have been updated to accommodate organizations. As you grow on QuantConnect, you may need more live nodes to run more live algorithms and more backtesting nodes for faster concurrent backtesting. You can subscribe to monthly plans which provide a set amount of additonal resources or you can subscribe to resources as you require them.
