The organization homepage is located in the Algorithm Lab. At the top of the Algorithm Lab page, you can find which organizations your account is associated with. You can also change which organization your account is currently connected to allowing you to choose which resources you wish to use. From here, you can also create a new organization, for which you will need to provide a unique name. New organizations will be initialized with the default community plan, which includes 1 backtesting node and 1 research node. You can learn more about the subscription plans available in the Subscription Plans documentation.
