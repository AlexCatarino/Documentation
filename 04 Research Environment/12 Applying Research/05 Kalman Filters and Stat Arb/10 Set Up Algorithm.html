<p>Once we are confident in our hypothesis, we can export this code into backtesting. One way to accomodate this model into backtest is to create a scheduled event which uses our model to predict the expected return.</p>

<p>We'll also need to create a function to train and update our model from time to time. We will switch <code>qb</code> with <code>self</code> and replace methods with their <code>QCAlgorithm</code> counterparts as needed. In this example, this is not an issue because all the methods we used in research also exist in <code>QCAlgorithm</code>.</p>
