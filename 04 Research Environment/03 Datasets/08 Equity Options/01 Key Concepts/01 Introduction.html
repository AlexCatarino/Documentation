  Equity Options are a financial derivative that gives the holder the right (but not the obligation) to buy or sell the underlying Equity, such as Apple, at the stated exercise price.
  This page explains the basics of Equity Option data in the Research Environment.
  To get some data, see <a href='/docs/v2/research-environment/datasets/equity-options/universes'>Universes</a> or <a href='/docs/v2/research-environment/datasets/equity-options/individual-contracts'>Individual Contracts</a>.
