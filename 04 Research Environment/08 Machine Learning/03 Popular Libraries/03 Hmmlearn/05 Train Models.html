<p>You need to <a href='/docs/v2/research-environment/machine-learning/popular-libraries/hmmlearn#04-Prepare-Data'>prepare the historical data</a> for training before you train the model. If you have prepared the data, build and train the model. In this example, assume the market has only 2 regimes and the market returns follow a Gaussian distribution. Therefore, create a 2-component Hidden Markov Model with Gaussian emissions, which is equivalent to a Gaussian mixture model with 2 means. Follow these steps to create the model:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Call the <code>GaussianHMM</code> constructor with the number of components, a covariance type, and the number of iterations.</li>
    <div class="section-example-container">
        <pre class="python">model = hmm.GaussianHMM(n_components=2, covariance_type="full", n_iter=100)</pre>
    </div>

    <li>Call the <code>fit</code> method with the training data.</li>
    <div class="section-example-container">
        <pre class="python">model.fit(X)</pre>
    </div>
</ol>
