QuantConnect provides Morningstar&reg; corporate fundamentals data for US Equities symbols.
    Morningstar Data for equities is used by many leading asset management firms, media companies,
    broker dealers, and other large institutions to support internal research functions, power investment tools,
    and deliver meaningful information and analysis to investors.
</p>
<p>
    For older symbols the file date is approximated as 45 days after the as of date. When a filing date is
    present on the Morningstar data it is used.
</p>
<p>
    As we are a quant platform; all the data is loaded using "As Original Reported" figures. If there was a
    mistake reporting the figure this will not be fixed later.
    The market typically responds quickly to these initially reported figures. Data is available for multiple
    periods depending on the property. Periods available include:
    1 mo, 2 mo, 3 mo, 6 mo, 9 mo, 12 mo, 1 Yr, 2 Yr, 3 Yr and 5 Yr.
</p>
<p>
    Morningstar symbols cover the NYSE, NASDAQ, AMEX and BATS exchanges.
