    The <code>lean report</code> command in the Lean CLI is a wrapper around the LEAN Report Creator.
    The LEAN Report Creator is a program included with LEAN which allows you to quickly generate polished, professional-grade reports of your backtests and live trading results.
    We hope that you can use these reports to share your strategy performance with prospective investors.
