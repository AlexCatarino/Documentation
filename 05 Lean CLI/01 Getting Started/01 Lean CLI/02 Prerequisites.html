<p>
    The Lean CLI is distributed as a Python package, so it requires <code>pip</code> to be installed. See <a href="https://www.lean.io/docs/lean-cli/tutorials/installation/installing-pip">Installing pip</a> to learn how to install pip on your operating system.
    Please note that the Python distribution from the  Microsoft Store is not supported, we recommend using the Anaconda distribution instead.

    The commands which run the LEAN engine locally also depend on <a href="https://www.docker.com/" target="_blank">Docker</a> being installed and running. See <a href="https://www.lean.io/docs/lean-cli/tutorials/installation/installing-docker">Installing Docker</a> to learn how to install Docker on your operating system.
