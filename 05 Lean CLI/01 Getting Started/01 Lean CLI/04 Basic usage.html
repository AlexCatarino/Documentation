<p>
    The CLI contains a lot of commands to make working on LEAN algorithms easier and more productive.
    Below we list some of the most common tasks, see the tutorials in the sidebar and the <a href="/docs/v2/lean-cli/api-reference/commands">command reference</a> for a complete overview of the supported features.
</p>

<h4>Authenticating with the cloud</h4>
<p>
    Before using the CLI to perform tasks in the cloud it is required to login with your QuantConnect API credentials.
    Run <code>lean login</code> to open an interactive wizard which will ask you for your user id and API token.
    Both of these credentials can be requested on <a href="https://www.quantconnect.com/account" target="_blank">quantconnect.com/account</a>, after which they'll be sent to your email address.
</p>

<h4>Pulling projects from the cloud</h4>
<p>
    Run <code>lean cloud pull</code> to pull your QuantConnect projects to your local drive.
    This command pulls all your cloud projects to your local drive while preserving your QuantConnect directory structure.
    If you have a lot of projects and only want to work locally on a few of them you can run this command with the <code>--project "Project Name"</code> option, which will make the command pull a single project instead.
</p>

<h4>Downloading data from the cloud</h4>
<p>
    This feature is not implemented yet.
</p>

<h4>Running a local backtest</h4>
<p>
    Run <code>lean backtest "Project Name"</code> to run a local backtest for the specified project.
    This command runs a backtest in a Docker container containing the same packages as the ones used on QuantConnect.com, but with your own data.
</p>

<h4>Pushing local changes to the cloud</h4>
<p>
    Run <code>lean cloud push</code> to push local changes to the QuantConnect.
    This command pushes all your local projects to the cloud and creates new cloud projects when necessary.
    If you only want to push a single project you can run this command with the <code>--project "Project Name"</code> command.
</p>

<h4>Running a cloud backtest</h4>
<p>
    Run <code>lean cloud backtest "Project Name"</code> to run a cloud backtest for the specified project.
    By default a summary of the results and a link to the full results is shown in the terminal.
    Running this command with the <code>--open</code> flag will automatically open the full results in the browser once the backtest is finished.
    Additionally you can run this command with the <code>--push</code> flag to push all local changes to the project to the cloud before running the backtest.
