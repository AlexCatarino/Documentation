    Run <code>pip install lean</code> in a terminal to install the latest version of the CLI.
</p>

<p>
    After installing the CLI, open a terminal in an empty directory and run <code>lean init</code>.
    This command downloads the latest configuration file and sample data from the <a href="https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean" target="_blank">QuantConnect/Lean</a> repository.
    We recommend running all Lean CLI commands in the same directory <code>lean init</code> was ran in.

    If you are on Windows and you are still using Docker with Hyper-V, you need to enable file sharing for your temporary directories and for the directory you ran <code>lean init</code> in.
    To do so, open your Docker settings, go to Resources &gt; File sharing and add <code>C:/Users/&lt;username&gt;/AppData/Local/Temp</code> and the directory you ran <code>lean init</code> in to the list.
