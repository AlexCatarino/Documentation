<p>
    Run <code>pip install lean</code> in a terminal to install the latest version of the CLI.
</p>

<p>
    After installing the CLI, open a terminal in an empty directory and run <code>lean init</code>.
    This command scaffolds a standard <a href="/docs/v2/lean-cli/user-guides/directory-structure">directory structure</a> containing all the files you need to get going.
    We recommend to run all Lean CLI commands in the same directory <code>lean init</code> was ran in.
