    An alternative to manually downloading all required data before running the backtest is to use the <code>ApiDataProvider</code>.
    This is data provider in LEAN which automatically downloads the data files that you added to your account when your backtest needs it.
    After it downloads a data file, it stores it in your local data directory so that in future runs it'll not have to download it again.

    You need to be logged in with <code>lean login</code> before you can use the ApiDataProvider.
    When you are logged in, open the <code>lean.json</code> file that was generated when you ran <code>lean init</code>.
    In the <code>lean.json</code> file, set the value of the <code>data-provider</code> to <code>QuantConnect.Lean.Engine.DataFeeds.ApiDataProvider</code> and save the file.
    After updating the <code>lean.json</code> file your local LEAN instance will automatically use the <code>ApiDataProvider</code> when you run it through the CLI.
