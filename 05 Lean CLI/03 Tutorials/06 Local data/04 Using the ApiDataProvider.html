    An alternative to manually downloading all required data before running the backtest is to use the <code>ApiDataProvider</code>.
    This data provider automatically downloads the data files that you added to your account when your backtest needs it.
    After it downloads a data file, it stores it in your local data directory so that in future runs it'll not have to download it again. Follow these steps to set up the <code>ApiDataProvider</code>:

<ol>
    <li>Log in using <code>lean login</code> if you haven't done so already.</li>
    <li>Open the <code>lean.json</code> file that was generated when you ran <code>lean init</code>.</li>
    <li>In the <code>lean.json</code> file, update the value of the <code>data-provider</code> property to <code>QuantConnect.Lean.Engine.DataFeeds.ApiDataProvider</code>.
    <li>Save the <code>lean.json</code> file. Your local LEAN instance now uses the <code>ApiDataProvider</code> when you run it through the CLI.
</ol>
