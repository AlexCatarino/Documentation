<p>
    Instead of using actual market data, you can also opt to use realistic fake data by using LEAN's random data generator.
    This generator uses a Brownian motion model to generate realistic market data.
    It is capable of generating data for most of LEAN's supported security types and resolutions, which makes it a good solution to design and test algorithms without the need to buy real financial data.
</p>

<p>
    Run <code>lean data generate --start 20150101 --symbol-count 10</code> to run the generator with minimal configuration.
    This command generates minute equity data since 01-01-2015 for 10 random symbols.
    You can also specify an end date using <code>--end &lt;yyyyMMdd&gt;</code>, generate data for a different security type using <code>--security-type &lt;type&gt;</code> or for a different resolution using <code>--resolution &lt;resolution&gt;</code>.
</p>

<p>
    By default dense data is generated, which means at least one data point per resolution step is generated.
    To generate more sparse data you can use <code>--data-density Sparse</code> to set it to at least one data point per 5 resolution steps, or <code>--data-density VerySparse</code> for at least one data point per 50 resolution steps.

    The random data generator supports the following security types and resolutions:
