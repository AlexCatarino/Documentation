<p>
    Run <code>lean report --backtest-data-source-file &lt;backtest file&gt;</code> to create a report, where <code>&lt;backtest file&gt;</code> should point to the output file of a locally ran backtest.
    This file is usually the largest JSON file in the output directory of a backtest.
    If you also want to include live trading results in the report you can enable that by providing <code>--live-data-source-file &lt;path&gt;</code>, where <code>&lt;path&gt;</code> should point to the JSON file containing the live trading results.
    By default, the generated report is saved to <code>./report.html</code>, although you can change the output location by specifying a custom path with <code>--report-destination &lt;path&gt;</code>.
</p>

<p>
    When generating a report you can also configure the following details, which are blank by default:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Strategy name: This name is displayed in the top-right corner of each page, and can be configured using <code>--strategy-name &lt;value&gt;</code>.</li>
    <li>Strategy version: This version is displayed next to the strategy name and can be configured using <code>--strategy-version &lt;value&gt;</code>.</li>
    <li>Strategy description: This description is displayed underneath the "Strategy Description" header on the first page and can be configured using <code>--strategy-description</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    When the given backtest data source file is stored a project directory (like <code>&lt;project&gt;/backtests/&lt;timestamp&gt;</code>), the default name is the name of the project directory and the default description is the description stored in the <a href="/docs/v2/lean-cli/user-guides/configuration#04-Project-configuration">project's configuration</a>.
