<p>
    A generated report contains various statistics about the backtest and optionally about the live trading results.
    Some of these statistics are formatted in a table, but most of them are formatted as professional-looking charts.
    This section describes the content of each generated chart.
</p>

<h4>Monthly returns</h4>
<p>
    This chart shows the return of each month.
    We convert original price series into monthly series and calculate the returns of each month.
    The green color indicates positive return, the red color indicates negative return.
    The greater the loss is, the darker the color is.
    The yellow color means the gain or loss is rather small.
    The white color means the month is not included in the backtest period.
    The values in the cells are in percentage.
</p>

<h4>Cumulative returns</h4>
<p>
    This chart shows the cumulative returns of your strategy in blue for backtesting, orange for live trading, and gray for the benchmark.
</p>

<h4>Annual returns</h4>
<p>
    This chart shows the return of each year.
    We calculate the total return within each year, shown by the blue bars.
    The red dotted line represents the average of the annual returns.
</p>

<h4>Returns per trade</h4>
<p>
    This chart shows a histogram showing the distribution of returns per trade over the algorithm's backtesting or live trading period.
</p>

<h4>Asset allocation</h4>
<p>
    The asset allocation chart shows a time-weighted average of each asset to your portfolio.
    When a certain asset has a very small percentage and is too small to be shown in the pie chart, it will be incorporated into an "Others" category.
    The value of the percentage could be either positive or negative.
</p>

<h4>Drawdown</h4>
<p>
    This chart shows the drawdown of each day.
    A certain day's drawdown is defined as the percentage of loss compared to the maximum value before this day.
    The drawdowns are calculated based on daily data.
    The top 5 drawdown periods are marked in the chart with different colors.

<h4>Crisis events</h4>
<p>
    This group of charts shows the behaviors of both your strategy and the benchmark during certain historical periods.
    We set the value of your strategy the same as the benchmark at the beginning of each crisis event, and the lines represent the cumulative returns of your strategy and benchmark from the beginning of the crisis event.
    The report only contains the crisis event charts whose periods are covered by your strategy.
