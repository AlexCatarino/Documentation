    Follow these steps to start local debugging for C# in VS Code:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Install version 15.8 of the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.mono-debug" target="_blank">Mono Debug</a> extension. You can do this by first installing the latest version and then clicking on the arrow button next to the Uninstall button, which opens a context menu containing the "Install Another Version" option.</li>
    <li>Run the <code>lean backtest</code> command with the <code>--debug mono</code> option.</li>
    <li>Wait until the CLI tells you to attach to the debugger.</li>
    <li>In VS Code, open the Run tab and run the configuration called "Debug with Lean CLI" (this configuration is created when you create a new project with the CLI).</li>
</ol>
