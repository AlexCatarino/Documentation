    Follow these steps to start local debugging for C# in Rider:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>Follow the <a href="/docs/v2/lean-cli/tutorials/local-autocomplete#05-C-and-Rider">How to set up local autocomplete for C# in Rider</a> tutorial.</li>
    <li>Open the directory containing the <code>Main.cs</code> file in a new Rider window. It is important that you open the project directory itself, not the directory you ran <code>lean init</code> in.</li>
    <li>Run the <code>lean backtest</code> command with the <code>--debug rider</code> option and wait until the CLI tells you to attach to the debugger.
<div class="section-example-container">
<pre>$ lean backtest "My Project" --debug rider
20210423 13:50:54.634 TRACE:: DebuggerHelper.Initialize(): waiting for debugger to attach...</pre>
</div>
    </li>
    <li>In Rider, select "Run > Attach To Remote Process...".</li>
    <li>In the pop-up that opens, select the target named "root@localhost:2222".</li>
    <li>Wait for Rider to connect and select the process named "dotnet QuantConnect.Lean.Launcher.dll" when a selector pops up to start debugging. You may have to select "Remote debugger tools are not loaded to the remote host. Click to load" first.</li>
</ol>
