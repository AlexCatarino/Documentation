    Backtesting is a way to test your algorithm on historic data.
    The CLI makes backtesting easier by providing simple commands to backtest your algorithms locally with your own data, or in the cloud with QuantConnect's data.
    Additionally the CLI also makes it easy to debug your algorithms locally using your editor's debugger.
