    Run <code>lean cloud backtest "Project Name"</code> to run a cloud backtest for a certain cloud project.
    This will start a cloud backtest, let you know about its progress and show you the summarized statistics and a link to the full results once the backtest is finished.
    You can use the <code>--open</code> flag if you want to automatically open the full results in the browser after the backtest has finished.
</p>

<p>
    If you have previously pulled the cloud project to your local drive using <code>lean cloud pull</code> you can also use the <code>--push</code> flag to automatically push modified files to the cloud before running the backtest.
    This prevents you from having to run manually <code>lean cloud push</code> every time you want to test (small) changes using a cloud backtest.
