    The Lean CLI supports local live trading with all brokerages supported by LEAN, which makes the transfer from backtesting to live trading as seamless as possible.
    This page contains instructions on how to start local live trading for all the brokerages supported by LEAN.
</p>

<p>
    In general, to start local live trading you need to follow these steps:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>Ensure a live trading environment for the brokerage you want to use exists in the <code>lean.json</code> file generated by <code>lean init</code>. These environments are stored in the <code>environments</code> object, which by default contains environments for all supported brokerages at the time that you run <code>lean init</code>.</li>
    <li>Ensure the configuration properties for the live trading environment are set correctly. These are the properties above the <code>environments</code> array in your <code>lean.json</code> file.</li>
    <li>Start local live trading by running <code>lean live &lt;project name&gt; &lt;environment name&gt;</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>
    This page contains the required live trading environment configuration and the required configuration properties for each supported brokerage.
    Before you add an environment to the <code>environments</code> object, ensure that there doesn't exist an environment with the same name yet.
    Before you add a new configuration property, ensure that there doesn't already exist a property with the required name (by default, the <code>lean.json</code> file already contains all properties supported at the time that you run <code>lean init</code>).
