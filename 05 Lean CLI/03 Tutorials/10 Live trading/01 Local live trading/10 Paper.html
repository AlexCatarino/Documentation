    Instead of live trading using actual money, you can also start paper trading locally.
    Although some brokerages have built-in support for paper trading, LEAN also offers a paper brokerage.
    This brokerage allows you to run live, real-time data through your algorithm while using fictional capital.
    To start local paper trading, make sure the following environment exists:
</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="json">
{
    "environments": {
        "live-paper": {
            "live-mode": true,

            "live-mode-brokerage": "PaperBrokerage",

            "setup-handler": "QuantConnect.Lean.Engine.Setup.BrokerageSetupHandler",
            "result-handler": "QuantConnect.Lean.Engine.Results.LiveTradingResultHandler",
            "data-feed-handler": "QuantConnect.Lean.Engine.DataFeeds.LiveTradingDataFeed",
            "data-queue-handler": "&lt;data queue handler&gt;",
            "real-time-handler": "QuantConnect.Lean.Engine.RealTime.LiveTradingRealTimeHandler",
            "transaction-handler": "QuantConnect.Lean.Engine.TransactionHandlers.BacktestingTransactionHandler"
        }
    }
}
</pre>
</div>

<p>
    The <code>&lt;data queue handler&gt;</code> must have the same value as the <code>data-queue-handler</code> of one of the other brokerages.
    You must also configure all the properties of the brokerage from which you copy the data queue handler.
    For example, you can set <code>data-queue-handler</code> to <code>BinanceBrokerage</code> and configure Binance's <a href="/docs/v2/lean-cli/tutorials/live-trading/local-live-trading#08-Binance">required properties</a> to use the live data feed from Binance.
</p>

<p>
    After setting up the environment, you can start local paper trading by running <code>lean live &lt;project name&gt; live-paper</code>.
