    Run <code>lean cloud live &lt;project name or id&gt;</code> to start live trading in the cloud, where <code>&lt;project name or id&gt;</code> is the name or id of a cloud project.
    This command starts an interactive wizard which lets you configure everything that you can configure via the Algorithm Lab's deployment wizard.
    The CLI prompts for the following configuration:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>The brokerage to use. You can choose between paper trading, Interactive Brokers, FXCM, OANDA, Bitfinex, or Coinbase Pro.</li>
    <li>The brokerage's configuration. Depending on the brokerage you choose in step 1 the CLI prompts for certain credentials, along with instructions on where to find or create them. These credentials are only used for your algorithm deployment, they are not saved by QuantConnect.</li>
    <li>The live node to run on. If you only have one live node, it will select that one automatically. If you have more than one live nodes that are not in use it lets you select the node to use. If you have no available live nodes an error is logged and the deployment aborts.</li>
    <li>Whether notifications should be enabled. In this step, you can request for your algorithm to send notifications when it generates an order event or emits an insight. You can configure any combination of email notifications, webhook notifications, and SMS notifications.</li>
    <li>Whether automatic restarting should be enabled. This feature attempts to restart your algorithm if it fails due to a runtime error. This can help improve its resilience to temporary errors such as brokerage API disconnection.</li>
</ol>

<p>
    After providing all the necessary configuration the CLI will ask you to confirm your input.
    After doing so, the CLI starts the deployment and provides you with the URL to the live results.
    Optionally, you can use the <code>--open</code> flag to automatically open this URL once the deployment starts.
