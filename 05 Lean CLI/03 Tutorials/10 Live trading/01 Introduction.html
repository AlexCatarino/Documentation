    The Lean CLI supports starting local and cloud live trading.
    We recommend live trading in our cloud as we can provide a battle-tested, colocated infrastructure racked in Equinix, maintained by our engineers to ensure the best possible stability and uptime.
    However, the CLI also makes it easy to run your algorithms in live mode locally, which makes it possible to use your own infrastructure and allows configuring LEAN beyond what you can do in the cloud.
