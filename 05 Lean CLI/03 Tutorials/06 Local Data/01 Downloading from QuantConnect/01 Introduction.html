<p>
    Running the LEAN engine locally with the CLI requires you to have your own local data.
    The recommended way to source local data is by purchasing and downloading it from QuantConnect Datasets.
    This way you can use the same data that is available to your algorithm when you run it in the cloud.
    You can download this data manually using the CLI or on-demand using LEAN.
    The available data and pricing information can be found in the <a href="https://www.lean.io/docs/lean-cli/user-guides/local-data#03-QuantConnect-Data-Library">user guides</a>.
