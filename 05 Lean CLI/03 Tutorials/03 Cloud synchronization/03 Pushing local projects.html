    Run <code>lean cloud push</code> to push all your local projects in the current directory to the cloud.
    This command pushes all locally modified files to the cloud and creates cloud files and projects when necessary.
    You can use the <code>--project "Project Name"</code> option to push a single project, where <code>Project Name</code> must be the path to the local project that should be pushed.

<p>
    Before uploading any files to the cloud the CLI performs <a href="/docs/v2/lean-cli/user-guides/cloud-synchronization#03-Pushing-local-projects">some checks</a> to make sure it doesn't perform unwanted destructive actions.
    If the CLI determines a problem with uploading a project's files, it logs a warning and skips the project.
