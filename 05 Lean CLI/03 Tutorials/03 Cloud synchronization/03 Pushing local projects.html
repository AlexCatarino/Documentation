<p>
    Run <code>lean cloud push</code> to push all your local projects in the current directory to the cloud.
    This will push all locally modified files to the cloud and will create cloud files and projects when necessary.
    You can use the <code>--project "Project Name"</code> option if you want to push single project, where <code>Project Name</code> should be the path to the local project that should be pushed.
</p>

<p>
    Before uploading any files to the cloud the CLI performs <a href="/docs/v2/lean-cli/user-guides/cloud-synchronization#03-Pushing-local-projectshtml">some checks</a> to make sure it doesn't perform unwanted destructive actions.
    If the CLI determines a problem with uploading a project's files, it will log a warning and skip the project.
