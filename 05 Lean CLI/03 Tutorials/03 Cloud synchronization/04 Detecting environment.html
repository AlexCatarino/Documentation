<p>
    Sometimes it might be useful to run certain logic only when your algorithm is running locally, or when it is running in the cloud.
    You can use the following code snippet to check where your algorithm is running (replace <code>Computer</code> with your computer's hostname):
</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="csharp">using System;

if (Environment.MachineName == "Computer")
{
    // Running locally
}
else
{
    // Running in the cloud
}</pre>
<pre class="python">import platform

if platform.node() == "Computer":
    # Running locally
    pass
else:
    # Running in the cloud
    pass</pre>
</div>
