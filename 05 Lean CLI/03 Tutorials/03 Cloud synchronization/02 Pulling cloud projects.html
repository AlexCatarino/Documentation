    Run <code>lean cloud pull</code> to pull all your cloud projects to your current directory.
    This command copies the cloud's entire directory structure to your local drive, so a cloud project named "My Strategy" in the "Strategies" directory is downloaded to <code>./Strategies/My Strategy</code>.
    You can use the <code>--project "Project Name"</code> option to pull a single project, where <code>Project Name</code> must be the id or the name of the cloud project that should be pulled.

    Before writing to files on your local drive the CLI performs <a href="/docs/v2/lean-cli/user-guides/cloud-synchronization#02-Pulling-cloud-projects">some checks</a> to make sure it doesn't perform unwanted destructive actions.
    If the CLI determines a problem with downloading a project's files, it logs a warning and skips the project.
