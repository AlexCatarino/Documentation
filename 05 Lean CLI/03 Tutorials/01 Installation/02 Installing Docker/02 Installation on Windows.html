<p>
    To install Docker on Windows your computer must meet the following requirements:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>A 64-bit processor</li>
    <li>4GB RAM or more</li>
    <li>Windows 10, version 1903 or higher (released May 2019)</li>
    <li>Hardware virtualization enabled in the BIOS</li>
</ul>

<p>
    After making sure you meet the requirements, follow these steps to install Docker on your computer:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>Download <a href="https://desktop.docker.com/win/stable/Docker%20Desktop%20Installer.exe" target="_blank">Docker Desktop Installer.exe</a>.</li>
    <li>Run the downloaded installer and ensure <b>Enable WSL 2 Features</b> is selected when prompted for it.</li>
    <li>Follow the instructions in the installation wizard to complete the installation.</li>
    <li>Restart your computer to ensure changes are propagated.</li>
</ol>

<p>
    After installing Docker and restarting your computer Docker might prompt you that the WSL 2 installation is incomplete.
    If that happens, follow the instructions in the dialog shown by Docker to finish the WSL 2 installation.
</p>

<p>
    By default, Docker does not start automatically when your computer starts.
    Because of this, you must manually start Docker when you run the LEAN engine with the CLI for the first time after starting your computer.
    To start Docker automatically, open the Docker Desktop application, go to Settings &gt; General and enable "Start Docker Desktop when you log in".
