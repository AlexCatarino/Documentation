<p>
    Run <code>pip uninstall lean</code> to uninstall the Lean CLI.
    To perform a full uninstallation you'll also need to delete <a href="/docs/v2/lean-cli/user-guides/configuration">configuration files</a> generated by the CLI.
    These might be found in the following directories:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>The <code>.lean</code> directory in your user's home directory.</li>
    <li>The directories you ran the <code>lean init</code>, <code>lean create-project</code> and/or <code>lean cloud pull</code> commands in.</li>
</ul>
