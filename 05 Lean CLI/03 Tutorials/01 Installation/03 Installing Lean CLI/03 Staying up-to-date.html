<p>
    We regularly update the CLI to add new features and to fix issues.
    It is therefore important to keep both the CLI and the Docker images that the CLI uses up-to-date.
</p>

<h4>Keeping the CLI up-to-date</h4>
<p>
    Run <code>pip install --upgrade lean</code> to update the CLI to the latest version.
    The CLI will automatically perform a version check once a day and warn you in case you are running an outdated version.
</p>

<h4>Keeping the Docker images up-to-date</h4>
<p>
    Various commands like <code>lean backtest</code>, <code>lean optimize</code> and <code>lean research</code> run the LEAN engine in a Docker container to ensure all the required dependencies are available.
    When you run these commands for the first time the Docker image containing LEAN and its dependencies is downloaded and stored.
    To update these images, run the command with the <code>--update</code> flag.
    These commands automatically perform a version check once every two weeks and warn you in case you are running an outdated Docker image.
