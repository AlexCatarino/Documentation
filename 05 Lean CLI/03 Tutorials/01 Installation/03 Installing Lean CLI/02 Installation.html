<p>
    After installing pip, run <code>pip install lean</code> to install the Lean CLI.
    This commands downloads all the CLI's dependencies and makes the <code>lean</code> command available in the terminal.
</p>

<p>
    After installing the CLI, open a terminal in an empty directory and run <code>lean init</code>.
    This command scaffolds a standard <a href="/docs/v2/lean-cli/user-guides/directory-structure">directory structure</a> containing a data directory and a <a href="/docs/v2/lean-cli/user-guides/configuration#03-Lean-configurationhtml">Lean configuration file</a>, both of which are required to run the LEAN engine locally.
    We recommend running all Lean CLI commands in the same directory <code>lean init</code> was ran in.
