    The Lean CLI supports optimizing a project's parameters in the cloud, which allows you to optimize your algorithm without needing your own powerful machine or data library.
    Optimization is helpful when you want to find the best combination of parameters to minimize or maximize a certain statistic, like the algorithm's Sharpe ratio or drawdown.
