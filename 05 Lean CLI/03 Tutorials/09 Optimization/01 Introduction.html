    The Lean CLI supports optimizing a project's parameters both locally and in the cloud using LEAN's powerful optimization strategies.
    This feature is helpful when you want to find the best combination of parameters to minimize or maximize a certain statistic, like the algorithm's Sharpe ratio or drawdown.
