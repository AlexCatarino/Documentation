    The Lean CLI supports optimizing a project's parameters both locally as well as in the cloud using LEAN's powerful optimization strategies.
    This is helpful when you want to find the best combination of parameters to minimize or maximize a certain target, like the algorithm's sharpe ratio or drawdown.
