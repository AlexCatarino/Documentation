    Run <code>lean cloud optimize "Project Name"</code> to run a cloud optimization for a certain cloud project.
    This commands starts an interactive wizard similar to the one shown when running local optimizations, which lets you configure the following:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>The target of the optimization. The target specifies what statistic you want to optimize and whether you want to minimize or maximize it.</li>
    <li>The parameters that must be optimized. For each of your project's parameters, the CLI asks you whether you want to optimize it and if so what its minimum and maximum values are and what step size to use.</li>
    <li>The constraints of the optimization. If the results of a certain parameter combination do not match all constraints the resulting backtest is removed from the final statistics. An example constraint is "Drawdown less than 0.25", which drops all parameter combinations for which the result has a drawdown greater than or equal to 25%.</li>
    <li>The node type to run the optimization on and the number of parallel nodes to use. This step lets you choose the amount of CPU cores and RAM your backtests need. After choosing a node type and number of parallel nodes the CLI will estimate the duration and cost of the optimization, and asks you to confirm the given input.</li>
</ol>

<p>
    After confirming the node type and number of parallel nodes the CLI starts the cloud optimization and lets you know about its progress.
    After the optimization is done, the CLI shows the optimal parameters (if they exist) and the statistics of the backtest with the optimal parameters.
</p>

<p>
    If you have previously pulled the cloud project to your local drive using <code>lean cloud pull</code> you can also use the <code>--push</code> flag to automatically push modified files to the cloud before starting the optimization.
    This flag prevents you from having to run manually <code>lean cloud push</code> every time you want to optimize (small) changes in the cloud.
