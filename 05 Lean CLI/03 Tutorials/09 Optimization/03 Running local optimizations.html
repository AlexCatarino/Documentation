    Run <code>lean optimize "Project Name"</code> to start an optimization for the project in <code>./Project Name</code>.
    This command starts an interactive wizard to let you configure the following:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>The optimization strategy to use. You can either choose for Grid Search, which runs through all possible combinations of parameters, or for Euler Search, which performs an Euler-like which gradually works towards smaller optimizations.</li>
    <li>The target of the optimization. This specifies what statistic you want to optimize, and whether you want to minimize or maximize it.</li>
    <li>The parameters which must be optimized. For each of your project's parameters the CLI asks you whether you want to optimize it, and if so what its minimum and maximum values are and what step size to use.</li>
    <li>The constraints of the optimization. If the results of a certain parameter combination does not match all constraints the resulting backtest is removed from the final statistics. An example constraint is "Drawdown less than 0.25", which drops all parameter combinations which result in a drawdown greater than or equal to 25%.</li>
</ol>

<p>
    The interactive wizard only supports configuring a subset of the configurable options.
    You can use the <code>--optimizer-config &lt;config file&gt;</code> option if you want to configure more than what the interactive wizard allows.
    This option must point to a file containing a full optimizer config (the <code>algorithm-type-name</code>, <code>algorithm-language</code> and <code>algorithm-location</code> properties may be omitted).
    See the <a href="https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean/blob/master/Optimizer.Launcher/config.json" target="_blank">Optimizer.Launcher/config.json</a> file in the LEAN repository for an example optimizer configuration file, which also contains documentation on all the required properties.
</p>

<p>
    After the configuration is done the optimizer starts running.
    By default the results of all backtests, the log of the optimizer and the used optimizer configuration are stored in the <code>&lt;project&gt;/optimizations/&lt;timestamp&gt;</code> directory.
    The <code>--output &lt;directory&gt;</code> option can be used to write output to a different directory.
