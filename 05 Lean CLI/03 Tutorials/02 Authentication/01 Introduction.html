    One of the main goals of the CLI is to make it easier to work on QuantConnect algorithms locally.
    To do so, some of the CLI's commands need to communicate with QuantConnect's API.
    Before it can do so, you must log in using your QuantConnect account so the CLI can send authenticated API requests.
