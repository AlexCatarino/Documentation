    Run <code>lean login</code> to login.
    This command opens an interactive wizard asking you for your user id and API token.
    Both of these credentials can be requested by clicking on the "Request Email With Token and Your User-Id for API Requests" link on <a href="https://www.quantconnect.com/account" target="_blank">QuantConnect.com/account</a>.
    After clicking on this link your user id and API token are automatically sent to your email address, from where you can copy-paste them into the wizard shown by <code>lean login</code>.
