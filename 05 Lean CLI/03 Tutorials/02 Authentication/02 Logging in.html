    Run <code>lean login</code> to login.
    This command opens an interactive wizard asking you for your user id and API token.
    Both of these credentials can be requested by clicking on the "Request Email With Token and Your User-Id for API Requests" link on <a href="https://www.quantconnect.com/account" target="_blank">QuantConnect.com/account</a>.
    This sends your user id and API token to your email address, which you can copy-paste into the wizard shown by <code>lean login</code>.
