    Follow these steps to set up local autocompletion for C# in Visual Studio:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Make sure the .NET Framework 4.6.2 SDK is installed in the Visual Studio Installer by clicking on the "Modify" button of the installed Visual Studio version and opening the "Individual components" tab on the window that shows up.</li>
    <li>Click on "Open a project or solution" on Visual Studio's home screen and open the <code>LeanCLI.csproj</code> file in the directory you ran <code>lean init</code> in and wait for the project to load. Visual Studio automatically downloads the required dependencies and indexes them to provide autocompletion.</li>
</ol>
