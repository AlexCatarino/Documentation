    To share code between Python projects, you can create library projects in the <code>Library</code> directory in to the directory you ran <code>lean init</code> in.
    If you have a <code>Library/Logging</code> project with a <code>functions.py</code> file, you can import all its members in any other Python project using <code>from Logging.functions import *</code>.
    Follow these steps to create a new library project:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>Open a terminal in the directory you ran <code>lean init</code> in.</li>
    <li>Run <code>lean create-project --language python "Library/MyLibrary"</code> to create a new library project named "MyLibrary".
<div class="section-example-container">
<pre>$ lean create-project --language python "Library/MyLibrary"
Successfully created Python project 'Library/MyLibrary'</pre>
</div>
        After running this command, you can import its members using <code>from MyLibrary.&lt;file name without extension&gt; import &lt;member name&gt;</code> in any other Python project.
    </li>
</ol>
