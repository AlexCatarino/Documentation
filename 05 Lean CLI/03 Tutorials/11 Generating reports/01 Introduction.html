    The <code>lean report</code> command in the Lean CLI is a wrapper around the LEAN Report Creator.
    The LEAN Report Creator is a program included with LEAN which allows you to quickly generate polished, professional-grade reports of your backtests.
    Optionally you can also include live trading results in these reports.
    We hope that you can use these reports to share your strategy performance with prospective investors.
