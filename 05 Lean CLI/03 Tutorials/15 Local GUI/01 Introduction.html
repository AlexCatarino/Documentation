    <b>Please note: the local GUI is currently in private beta and is planned to be released mid-August. The instructions on this page are not applicable to you if you're not part of the private beta.</b>
</p>

<p>
    The local GUI is an add-on to the CLI which provides a graphical user interface similar to the one provided on QuantConnect.
    This GUI makes it easier to use the CLI to run backtests, optimizations and live deployments locally.
    It also provides rich and interactive visualizations to all of these, including live updates while backtests and live deployments are running.
</p>

<p>
    The local GUI is available for $1 per month and can be subscribed to on the <a href="https://www.quantconnect.com/pricing">Pricing</a> page.
