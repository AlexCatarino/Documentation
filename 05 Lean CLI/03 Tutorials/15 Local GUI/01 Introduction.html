    The local GUI is an add-on to the CLI which provides a graphical user interface similar to the one provided on QuantConnect.
    This GUI makes it easier to use the CLI to run backtests, optimizations and live deployments locally.
    It also provides rich and interactive visualizations to all of these, including live updates while backtests and live deployments are running.

    The local GUI is a paid addition to the CLI and can be subscribed to on the <a href="https://www.quantconnect.com/pricing">Pricing</a> page.
