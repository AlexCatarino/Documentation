    Follow these steps to add custom libraries to your Python project:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>Find the name of the package that you want to add on <a href="https://pypi.org/" target="_blank">PyPI</a>.</li>
    <li>Open a terminal in the directory you ran <code>lean init</code> in.</li>
    <li>Run <code>lean library add "My Project" altair</code> to add the <code>altair</code> PyPI package to the project in <code>./My Project</code>, replacing <code>altair</code> with the name of the package found in step 1.
<div class="section-example-container">
<pre>$ lean library add "My Project" altair
Retrieving latest compatible version from PyPI
Adding altair 4.1.0 to 'My Project/requirements.txt'
Installing altair 4.1.0 in local Python environment to provide local autocomplete
</pre>
    This command installs the latest version of the <code>altair</code> package that is compatible with Python 3.6 (which is what the official LEAN Docker images use).
    If you want to use a different version you can use the <code>--version &lt;value&gt;</code> option.
    Additionally, you can pass the <code>--no-local</code> flag to skip installing the package in your local Python environment.
</div>
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    Additionally, you can also add custom Python libraries to your project by adding the library to your project's <code>requirements.txt</code> file.
    If you choose to do this, make sure that the library versions that you add to this file are compatible with Python 3.6, because that's what the official LEAN Docker images use.
