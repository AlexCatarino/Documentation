    Follow these steps to add custom libraries to your C# project:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>Find the name of the package that you want to add on <a href="https://www.nuget.org/" target="_blank">NuGet</a>.</li>
    <li>Open a terminal in the directory you ran <code>lean init</code> in.</li>
    <li>Run <code>lean library add "My Project" Microsoft.ML</code> to add the <code>Microsoft.ML</code> NuGet package to the project in <code>./My Project</code>, replacing <code>Microsoft.ML</code> with the name of the package found in step 1.
<div class="section-example-container">
<pre>$ lean library add "My Project" Microsoft.ML
Retrieving latest available version from NuGet
Adding Microsoft.ML 1.5.5 to 'My Project/My Project.csproj'
Restoring packages in 'My Project' to provide local autocomplete
</pre>
    This command installs the latest version of the <code>Microsoft.ML</code> package.
    If you want to use a different version you can use the <code>--version &lt;value&gt;</code> option.
    Additionally, you can pass the <code>--no-local</code> flag to skip restoring the packages locally.
</div>
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    Additionally, you can also add custom C# libraries to your project by adding a <code>PackageReference</code> to it in your C# project.
    This can be done manually or through your editor's built-in NuGet tooling if your editor has such a feature.
