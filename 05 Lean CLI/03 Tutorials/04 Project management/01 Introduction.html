    One of the goals of the Lean CLI is to be similar to QuantConnect's cloud environment to make hybrid local-cloud development possible.
    Just like in the cloud, algorithms in a Lean CLI directory are each stored in a separate project with its own directory and configuration.
    The CLI attempts to make it as easy as possible to create new projects.
