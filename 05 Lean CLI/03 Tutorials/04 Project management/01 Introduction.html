    One of the goals of the Lean CLI is to be similar to QuantConnect's cloud environment to make hybrid local-cloud development possible.
    Just like in the cloud, the CLI lets you create separate projects for each algorithm you write, each project having its own directory and configuration.
    The CLI attempts to make it as easy as possible to create new projects.
