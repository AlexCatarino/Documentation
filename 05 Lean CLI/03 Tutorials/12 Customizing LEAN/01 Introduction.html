<p>
    By default the CLI uses the official LEAN Docker images when running the LEAN engine or the research environment.
    However, the CLI also supports custom Docker images.
    This makes it possible to use your own version of LEAN and allows using libraries which aren't available in the official images.
    To make this feature easier to use, the CLI is also capable of building Docker images of your own version of LEAN using a single command.
