            <td>
                The command you tried to run does not exist or it doesn't support the option you provided.
                If the documentation says it is available you are probably using an outdated version of the CLI.
                Run <code>pip install --upgrade lean</code> to update to the latest version.

            </td>
            <td>
                You are trying to use a command which communicates with the QuantConnect API and you haven't authenticated yourself yet.
                Run <code>lean login</code> to log in with your API credentials.

                Please make sure Docker is installed and running
            </td>
            <td>
                You are trying to use a command which needs to run the LEAN engine locally, which always happens in a Docker container.
                Make sure Docker is running if you installed it already, or visit <a href="https://www.lean.io/docs/lean-cli/tutorials/installation/installing-docker">Installing Docker</a> if you haven't.

        <tr>
            <td>
                This command requires a Lean configuration file, run `lean init` in an empty directory to create one, or specify the file to use with --lean-config
            </td>
            <td>
                The command you are trying to run requires a <a href="https://www.lean.io/docs/lean-cli/user-guides/configuration#03-Lean-configuration">Lean configuration</a> file.
                The CLI automatically tries to find this file by recursively looking in the current directory and all of the parent directories for a <code>lean.json</code> file.
                This error is shown if no such file can be found.
                It can be fixed by running the command in a directory you have previously ran <code>lean init</code> in (which generates the <code>lean.json</code> file), or by specifying the path to the <code>lean.json</code> file with the <code>--lean-config</code> option.

                Invalid value for 'PROJECT': Path '&lt;path&gt;' does not exist.
            </td>
            <td>
                You are trying to run an action on a project but specified an invalid project path.
                Make sure you are running the command from the directory in which you ran <code>lean init</code> and make sure <code>./&lt;path&gt;</code> points to an existing directory.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                '&lt;path&gt;' is not a valid path
            </td>
            <td>
                You provided a path that is not valid for your operating system.
                This error is most likely to appear on Windows, where the following characters are not allowed in path components: <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>:</code>, <code>"</code>, <code>|</code>, <code>?</code>, and <code>*</code>.
                On top of those characters the following names are not allowed (case-insensitive): <code>CON</code>, <code>PRN</code>, <code>AUX</code>, <code>NUL</code>, <code>COM1</code> until <code>COM9</code>, and <code>LPT1</code> until <code>LPT9</code>.
                Last but not least, path components cannot start or end with a space or end with a period on Windows.

            <td>
                Your Mac's Docker file sharing settings do not permit binding one or more directories that we need to share with the container.
                Go to Docker's <code>Preferences-&gt;Resources-&gt;File Sharing</code> and add <code>/private/var/folders</code> and either <code>/Users</code>
                to share your entire /Users directory, or <code>/Users/&lt;path&gt;</code> where 'path' is the path to your QuantConnect directory, which should have
                a <code>data</code> child directory, and child directories for your individual projects.

                Docker wants access to &lt;path&gt;
            </td>
            <td>
                You are running Docker on Windows using the legacy Hyper-V backend and haven't configured file sharing correctly.
                You need to enable file sharing for your temporary directories and for the directory you ran <code>lean init</code> in.
                To do so, open your Docker settings, go to Resources &gt; File sharing and add <code>C:/Users/&lt;username&gt;/AppData/Local/Temp</code> and the directory you ran <code>lean init</code> in to the list.
                Click Apply &amp; Restart after making the required changes.
