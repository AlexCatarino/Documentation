    Run <code>pip install lean</code> in a terminal to install the latest version of the CLI.
</p>

<p>
    After installing the CLI, open a terminal in an empty directory and run <code>lean init</code>.
    This command downloads the latest configuration file and sample data from the <a href="https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean" target="_blank">QuantConnect/Lean</a> repository.
    We recommend running all Lean CLI commands in the same directory <code>lean init</code> was ran in.
</p>

<pre>$ lean init
Downloading latest sample data from the Lean repository...
The following objects have been created:
- lean.json contains the configuration used when running the LEAN engine locally
- data/ contains the data that is used when running the LEAN engine locally

<p>
    If you are running Docker on Windows using the legacy Hyper-V backend instead of the new WSL 2 backend, you also need to enable file sharing for your temporary directories and for the directory you ran <code>lean init</code> in.
    To do so, open your Docker settings, go to <span class='menu-name'>Resources &gt; File sharing</span> and add <span class='private-file-name'>C:/Users/<span class='placeholder-text'>username</span>/AppData/Local/Temp</span> and the directory you ran <code>lean init</code> in to the list.
    Click <span class='button-name'>Apply & Restart</span> after making the required changes.
