<p>Before you start installing the Lean CLI, check the requirements of <a href='/docs/v2/lean-cli/live-trading/brokerages'>deploying with your brokerage</a> to ensure you have a compatible machine and review the <a href='/docs/v2/cloud-platform/live-trading/brokerages'>integration documentation for your brokerage</a> so you are aware of what functionality is available through the integration.</p>

<p>
    The Lean CLI is distributed as a Python package, so it requires <code>pip</code> to be installed. See <a href="/docs/v2/lean-cli/installation/installing-pip">Installing pip</a> to learn how to install pip on your operating system. Note that the Python distribution from the Microsoft Store is not supported, we recommend using the Anaconda distribution instead.
</p>

<p>
    The commands which run the LEAN engine locally also depend on <a href="https://www.docker.com/" target="_blank" rel='nofollow'>Docker</a> being installed and running. See <a href="/docs/v2/lean-cli/installation/installing-lean-cli#02-Install-Docker">Install Docker</a> to learn how to install Docker on your operating system.
</p>

<p>To use the CLI, you must be a member in an <a href='https://www.quantconnect.com/docs/v2/cloud-platform/organizations/tier-features'>organization</a> on a paid tier.</p>
