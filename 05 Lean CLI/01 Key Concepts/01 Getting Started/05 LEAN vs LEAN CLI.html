<p>LEAN is the open-source algorithmic trading engine. LEAN CLI is the way we recommend you run LEAN on your local machine. The LEAN CLI can do almost everything that LEAN can do. There are just some programs in the <a rel='nofollow' target="_blank" href='https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean/blob/master/ToolBox/README.md'>ToolBox</a> that the LEAN CLI can't currently run. The <code>lean data generate</code> is a wrapper for the random data generator in the ToolBox. However, if you need any of the other programs in the ToolBox, you'll have to run LEAN manually and move the downloaded/parsed data to the CLI's <span class='private-file-name'>data</span> directory.</p>
