    Running the LEAN engine locally with the Lean CLI always happens in a Docker container.
    These Docker containers contain a minimal Linux-based operating system, the LEAN engine, and all the packages available to you on QuantConnect.com.
    It is therefore required to install Docker if you plan on using the CLI to run the LEAN engine locally.
