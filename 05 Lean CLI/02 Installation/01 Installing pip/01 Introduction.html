<p>
    The Lean CLI is distributed as a Python package, so it requires <code>pip</code> to be installed.
    Because <code>pip</code> is distributed as a part of Python you must install Python before you can install the CLI.

<p>
    This page contains installation instructions for <a href="https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/" target="_blank">Anaconda</a>, which is a Python distribution containing a lot of packages that are also available when running the LEAN engine.
    Having these packages installed locally makes it possible for your editor to provide autocomplete for them.

    Please note that the Python distribution from the Microsoft Store is not supported.
