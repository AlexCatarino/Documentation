<p>To add files to your Object Store, add them to the <span class='public-directory-name'>storage</span> directory of your <a href='/docs/v2/lean-cli/initialization/organization-workspaces'>organization workspace</a> or call the <a href='https://www.quantconnect.com/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/object-store#04-Save-Data'>Save methods</a> in your algorithm.</p>

<p>To view the contents of the Object Store, run <code>lean object-store ls</code>.</p>

<div class="cli section-example-container">
<pre>$ lean object-store ls</pre>
</div>

<p>This command opens File Explorer to show the <span class='public-directory-name'>storage</span> directory. You can delete and rename files in the Object Store directly from the File Explorer. To edit files, open them in a text editor.</p>
