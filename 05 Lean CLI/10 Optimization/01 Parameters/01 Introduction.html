<p>
    Project parameters are parameters that are defined in your project's <a href="/docs/v2/lean-cli/projects/configuration">configuration file</a>.
    These parameters are a replacement for constants in your algorithm and can be optimized using one of LEAN's optimization strategies either locally or in the cloud.
