<p>
    Pulls projects from QuantConnect to your local directory, while preserving the directory structure of your projects on QuantConnect.
    Both files as well as project parameters are pulled from the cloud.
    By default all cloud projects are pulled, unless a <code>--project</code> is specified, in which case a single project is pulled.
</p>

<p>
    Before pulling a cloud project the CLI will check if the local directory with the same path already exists.
    If it does and the local directory is not linked to the cloud project (because of an earlier <code>lean cloud pull</code> or <code>lean cloud push</code>) the CLI will skip pulling the cloud project and log a descriptive warning message.
</p>

<p>
    Local files which do not exist in the cloud will not be deleted by this command.
