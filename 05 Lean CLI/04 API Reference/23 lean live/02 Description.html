<p>
    Starts local live trading in a Docker container using the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/quantconnect/lean" target="_blank">quantconnect/lean</a> Docker image.
    The logs of the algorithm are shown in real-time and the full results are stored in the <code>&lt;project&gt;/live/&lt;timestamp&gt;</code> directory.
    You can use the <code>--output</code> option to change the output directory.
</p>

<p>
    The given <code>&lt;project&gt;</code> argument must be either a project directory or a file containing the algorithm to run a backtest for.
    If it is a project directory the CLI looks for a <code>main.py</code> or <code>Main.cs</code> file, assuming the first file it finds to contain the algorithm to run.
</p>

<p>
    The given environment must be one of the live environments stored in your <a href="/docs/v2/lean-cli/user-guides/configuration#03-Lean-configuration">Lean configuration file</a>.
    This means the environment must have the <code>live-mode</code> property set to <code>true</code>.
    For most brokerages, you also need to configure some additional properties in the Lean configuration file, like your brokerage credentials.
    The required environment and properties for each brokerage are listed on the <a href="/docs/v2/lean-cli/tutorials/live-trading/local-live-trading">Local live trading</a> page.
</p>

<p>
    The Docker image that is used contains the same libraries as the ones <a href="/docs/v2/lean-cli/user-guides/supported-libraries">available on QuantConnect</a>.
    If the selected project is a C# project it is compiled before starting live trading.
</p>

<p>
    By default, the official LEAN engine image is used.
    You can override this using the <code>--image &lt;value&gt;</code> option.
    Alternatively, you can set the default engine image for all commands using <code>lean config set engine-image &lt;value&gt;</code>.
    The image is pulled before starting the local live trading if it doesn't exist locally yet or if you pass the <code>--update</code> flag.
