    Removes a custom library from a project.
    This command can remove libraries which are added using <code>lean library add</code>, as well as libraries which were manually added to the C# project file or a Python project's <code>requirements.txt</code> file.

    Custom C# libraries are removed from your C# project file (the file ending in <code>.csproj</code>).
    If <code>dotnet</code> is on your <code>PATH</code> and <code>--no-local</code> is not given the CLI also restores all dependencies using <code>dotnet restore</code>.

    Custom Python libraries are removed from your project's <code>requirements.txt</code> file.
