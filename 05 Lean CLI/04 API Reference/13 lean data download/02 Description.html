    Lets you purchase and download data from the QuantConnect Data Library.
    This command performs the following actions:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>You are asked to select the organization which should be billed. This step is skipped if you are only a member of a single organization.</li>
    <li>An interactive wizard is shown allowing you to configure exactly which data you want to download.</li>
    <li>You are asked to accept the CLI API Access and Data Agreement in your web browser.</li>
    <li>You are asked to confirm the purchase one last time.</li>
    <li>The CLI downloads the requested files while charging the organization selected in step 1.</li>
</ol>

<p>
    The available data and pricing information can be found in the <a href="https://www.lean.io/docs/lean-cli/user-guides/local-data#03-QuantConnect-Data-Library">user guides</a>.
    Data is priced on a per-file per-download basis, meaning you pay a certain number of QuantConnect Credits (QCC) for each file you download.
    The required QCC is deducted from your organization's QCC balance when a file is downloaded.
    If you force-quit the command before it downloaded all requested files, you are not charged for the files you didn't download.
</p>

<p>
    In case the local data already exists a warning is logged and you are given the choice of whether you want to enable overwriting existing data or not.
    Use the <code>--overwrite</code> flag to override this behavior and enable overwriting existing data in all such cases.
