<p>
    Runs a local backtest in a Docker container using the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/quantconnect/lean" target="_blank">quantconnect/lean</a> Docker image.
    The logs of the backtest are shown in real-time and the full results are stored in the <code>&lt;project&gt;/backtest/&lt;timestamp&gt;</code> directory.
    You can use the <code>--output</code> option to change the output directory.
</p>

<p>
    The given <code>&lt;project&gt;</code> argument must be either a project directory or a file containing the algorithm to run a backtest for.
    If it is a project directory the CLI looks for a <code>main.py</code> or <code>Main.cs</code> file, assuming the first file it finds to contain the algorithm to run.
</p>

<p>
    If the <code>--debug</code> option is given this command configures the Docker container in such a way to allow debugging using your editor's debugger.
    The exact ways to get local debugging to work depends on your editor and language, see <a href="/docs/v2/lean-cli/tutorials/backtesting/debugging-local-backtests">Debugging local backtests</a> for more information on how to set this up.
</p>

<p>
    The Docker image that is used contains the same libraries as the ones <a href="/docs/v2/lean-cli/user-guides/supported-libraries">available on QuantConnect</a>.
    If the selected project is a C# project the project is first compiled in a separate container, but using the same image.
</p>

<p>
    By default, the official LEAN engine image is used.
    You can override this using the <code>--image &lt;value&gt;</code> option.
    Alternatively, you can set the default engine image for all commands using <code>lean config set engine-image &lt;value&gt;</code>.
    The image is pulled before running the backtest if it doesn't exist locally yet or if you pass the <code>--update</code> flag.
