<p>
    Starts local live trading in a Docker container using the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/quantconnect/lean" target="_blank">quantconnect/lean</a> Docker image.
    The logs of the algorithm are shown in real-time and the full results are stored in the <code>&lt;project&gt;/live/&lt;timestamp&gt;</code> directory.
    You can use the <code>--output</code> option to change the output directory.
</p>

<p>
    The given <code>&lt;project&gt;</code> argument must be either a project directory or a file containing the algorithm to run a backtest for.
    If it is a project directory the CLI looks for a <code>main.py</code> or <code>Main.cs</code> file, assuming the first file it finds to contain the algorithm to run.
</p>

<p>
    The given environment must be one of the live environments stored in your <a href="/docs/v2/lean-cli/user-guides/configuration#03-Lean-configuration">Lean configuration file</a>.
    This means the environment must have the <code>live-mode</code> property set to <code>true</code>.
    For most brokerages, you also need to configure some additional properties in the Lean configuration file, like your brokerage credentials.
    The required environment and properties for each brokerage are listed on the <a href="/docs/v2/lean-cli/tutorials/live-trading/local-live-trading">Local live trading</a> page.
</p>

<p>
    The Docker image that is used contains the same libraries as the ones <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/user-guides/key-concepts/supported-libraries">available on QuantConnect</a>.
    If the selected project is a C# project the project is first compiled in a separate container, but using the same image.
</p>

<p>
    By default, the latest installed version of the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/quantconnect/lean" target="_blank">quantconnect/lean</a> Docker image is used.
    If this image doesn't exist locally yet or if you specify the <code>--update</code> option it is pulled before starting the local live trading.
    You can specify a custom tag to use with the <code>--version</code> option.
