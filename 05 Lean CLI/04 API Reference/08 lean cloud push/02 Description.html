<p>
    Pushes local projects to QuantConnect while preserving the directory structure of your local projects.
    Both files as well as project parameters are pushed to the cloud.
    By default all local projects are pulled, unless a <code>--project</code> is specified, in which case a single project is pushed.
</p>

<p>
    Before pushing a local project the CLI will check if the cloud project with the same path already exists.
    If it does and the cloud project is not linked to the local project (because of an earlier <code>lean cloud pull</code> or <code>lean cloud push</code>) the CLI will skip pushing the cloud project and log a descriptive warning message.
    If the cloud project does not exist yet the CLI will create it for you and push the contents of the local project to the newly created cloud project.
</p>

<p>
    Files in the cloud which don't exist locally will not be deleted by this command.
