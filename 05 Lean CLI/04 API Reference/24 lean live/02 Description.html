<p>
    Starts local live trading in a Docker container using the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/quantconnect/lean" target="_blank">quantconnect/lean</a> Docker image.
    The logs of the algorithm are shown in real-time and the full results are stored in the <code>&lt;project&gt;/live/&lt;timestamp&gt;</code> directory.
    You can use the <code>--output</code> option to change the output directory.
</p>

<p>
    The given <code>&lt;project&gt;</code> argument must be either a project directory or a file containing the algorithm to run a backtest for.
    If it is a project directory the CLI looks for a <code>main.py</code> or <code>Main.cs</code> file, assuming the first file it finds to contain the algorithm to run.
</p>

<p>
    By default, an interactive wizard is shown letting you configure the brokerage and data feed to use.
    When the <code>--environment</code> option is given this wizard is skipped and the environment with the given name is used instead.
    The given environment must be one of the live environments stored in your <a href="https://www.lean.io/docs/lean-cli/user-guides/configuration#03-Lean-configuration">Lean configuration file</a>.
    This means the environment must have the <code>live-mode</code> property set to <code>true</code>.
</p>

<p>
    The Docker image that is used contains the same libraries as the ones <a href="https://www.lean.io/docs/lean-cli/user-guides/supported-libraries">available on QuantConnect</a>.
    If the selected project is a C# project it is compiled before starting live trading.
</p>

<p>
    By default, the official LEAN engine image is used.
    You can override this using the <code>--image &lt;value&gt;</code> option.
    Alternatively, you can set the default engine image for all commands using <code>lean config set engine-image &lt;value&gt;</code>.
    The image is pulled before starting the local live trading if it doesn't exist locally yet or if you pass the <code>--update</code> flag.
