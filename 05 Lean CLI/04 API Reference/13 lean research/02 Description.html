<p>
    Runs a local Jupyter Lab environment in a Docker container using the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/quantconnect/research" target="_blank">quantconnect/research</a> Docker image.
    This mounts the entire project directory in the Docker container and exposes the Jupyter Lab instance on a local port.
    After the Jupyter Lab instance has started the browser is automatically opened.
</p>

<p>
    By default Jupyter Lab is exposed on port 8888.
    If you want to use a custom port you can use the <code>--port</code> option, which may be useful if you want to run two Jupyter Lab instances side-by-side.
</p>

<p>
    If you have previously logged in using <code>lean login</code> the CLI automatically makes your credentials available in the Jupyter Lab instance.
    This means the <code>api</code> variable is automatically assigned an instance of <a href="https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean/blob/master/Api/Api.cs" target="_blank">Api</a> in your research notebooks which you can use to make authenticated requests to the QuantConnect API.
</p>

<p>
    By default the latest installed version of the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/quantconnect/research" target="_blank">quantconnect/research</a> Docker image is used.
    If this image doesn't exist locally yet or if you specify the <code>--update</code> option it is pulled before starting the research environment.
    You can specify a custom tag to use with the <code>--version</code> option.
