    Runs an optimization for a cloud project.
    Before starting the optimization the CLI will show an interactive wizard letting you configure the target, parameters, constraints, node type and number of parallel nodes.
    While running the optimization a progress bar is shown to keep you up-to-date on the status of the optimization.
    After running the optimization the optimal parameters and the statistics of the backtest with the optimal parameters are logged.

    If you have a local copy of the cloud project you can use the <code>--push</code> option to push local modifications to the cloud before starting the optimization.
