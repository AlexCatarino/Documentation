    Follow these steps to push all the local projects in an <a href="https://www.quantconnect.com/docs/v2/lean-cli/initialization/organization-workspaces">organization workspace</a> to the cloud:
</p>

<ol>
    <li><a href="/docs/v2/lean-cli/initialization/authentication#02-Log-In">Log in</a> to the CLI if you haven't done so already.</li>
    <li>Open a terminal in the organization workspace.</li>
    <li>Run <code>lean cloud push</code> to push all your local projects in the organization to the cloud, creating new cloud projects where necessary.
<div class="cli section-example-container">
<pre>$ lean cloud push

    Follow these steps to push a single local project to the cloud:
</p>

<ol>
    <li><a href="/docs/v2/lean-cli/initialization/authentication#02-Log-In">Log in</a> to the CLI if you haven't done so already.</li>
    <li>Open a terminal in the <a href="/docs/v2/lean-cli/initialization/organization-workspaces">organization workspace</a> that contains the project you want to push.</li>
    <li>Run <code>lean cloud push --project "&lt;projectName&gt;"</code> to push the project stored in <span class="public-directory-name">. / &lt;projectName&gt;</span> to the cloud.
<div class="cli section-example-container">
<pre>$ lean cloud push --project "My Project"
[1/1] Pushing 'My Project'
Successfully updated cloud file 'My Project/main.py'</pre>
</div>
    </li>
</ol>

<p>If you create a project on your local machine and push it to the cloud, the <code>lean cloud push</code> command creates the cloud version of the project in the organization that's linked to your current organization workspace.</p>

<p>If you have a cloud copy of the project when you push the project from your local machine, the <a href="/docs/v2/lean-cli/projects/configuration#02-Properties">configuration values of your local project</a> overwrite the configuration values of your cloud copy.</p>

<p>The CLI only pushes the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.quantconnect.com/docs/v2/cloud-platform/projects/files#02-Supported-File-Types">supported file types</a> in your projects.</p>
