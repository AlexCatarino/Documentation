    Follow these steps to push all the local projects that you store in a single organization to the cloud:

<ol>
    <li><a href="/docs/v2/lean-cli/initialization/authenticating-accounts#02-Log-In">Log in</a> to the CLI if you haven't done so already.</li>
    <li>Open a terminal in the <a href="/docs/v2/lean-cli/initialization/workspace">workspace</a> of the organization that contains the projects you want to push.</li>
    <li>Run <code>lean cloud push</code> to push all your local projects in the organization to the cloud, creating new cloud projects where necessary.

    <li><a href="/docs/v2/lean-cli/initialization/authenticating-accounts#02-Log-In">Log in</a> to the CLI if you haven't done so already.</li>
    <li>Open a terminal in the <a href="/docs/v2/lean-cli/initialization/workspace">workspace</a> of the organization that contains the project you want to push.</li>
    <li>Run <code>lean cloud push --project "&lt;projectName&gt;"</code> to push the project stored in <span class="private-directory-name">./&lt;projectName&gt;</span> to the cloud.
<div class="cli section-example-container">

<p>If you create a project on your local machine and push it to the cloud, the <code>lean cloud push</code> command creates the cloud version of the project in the organization that's linked to your current workspace.</p>

<p>If you have a cloud copy of the project when you push the project from your local machine, the <a href='/docs/v2/lean-cli/projects/configuration#02-Properties'>configuration values of your local project</a> overwrite the configuration values of your cloud copy.</p>
