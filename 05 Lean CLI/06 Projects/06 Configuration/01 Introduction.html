    Project-specific configuration is stored in the project directory in the <span class="public-file-name">config.json</span> file.
    This file is automatically generated when you run <code>lean project-create</code> or <code>lean cloud pull</code>.
    Just like the global and Lean configuration files, the project configuration is stored as JSON but without support for comments.
