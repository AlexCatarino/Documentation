<p>
    A locally-focused workflow (local development, local execution) with the CLI might look like this:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>Open a terminal in the directory you ran <code>lean init</code> in.</li>
    <li>Run <code>lean create-project "&lt;projectName&gt;"</code> to create a new project with some basic code to get you started.</li>
    <li>Work on your strategy in <span class="private-directory-name">./&lt;projectName&gt;</span>.</li>
    <li>Run <code>lean research "&lt;projectName&gt;"</code> to start a Jupyter Lab session to perform research.</li>
    <li>Run <code>lean backtest "&lt;projectName&gt;"</code> to run a backtest whenever there's something to test. This command runs your strategy in a Docker container containing the same packages as the ones used on QuantConnect.com, but with your own data.</li>
</ol>

<p>
    With this workflow, you are not limited to the computing power that's available in QuantConnect's infrastructure, because everything runs locally.
    On the other hand, this also means you must have all your required data available locally.
    To download some of QuantConnect's data for local usage, see <a href="/docs/v2/lean-cli/datasets/downloading-quantconnect-data">Downloading QuantConnect Data</a>.
