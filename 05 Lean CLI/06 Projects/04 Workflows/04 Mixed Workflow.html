    A mixed workflow (local development, local debugging, and cloud execution) with the CLI might look like this:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>Open a terminal in your <a href='/docs/v2/lean-cli/initialization/directory-structure#02-lean-init'>CLI root directory</a>.</li>
    <li>Run <code>lean cloud pull</code> to pull remotely changed files.</li>
    <li>Start programming on your strategies.</li>
    <li>Whenever you want to debug a strategy in your local development environment, see <a href="/docs/v2/lean-cli/backtesting/debugging">Debugging</a>.</li>
    <li>Whenever you want to backtest a strategy, run <code>lean cloud backtest "&lt;projectName&gt;" --open --push</code> to push local changes to the cloud, run a backtest in the cloud, and open the results in the browser once finished.</li>
    <li>When you're finished for the moment, run <code>lean cloud push</code> to push all locally changed files to the cloud.</li>
</ol>

<p>
    The advantage of this workflow is that you can use your local development environment and its debugging tools when writing your algorithms while using QuantConnect's infrastructure and data in backtesting and live trading.
    Although this does require you to have a local copy of the data that your strategy needs, it doesn't require you to maintain your own infrastructure and data feeds in live trading. To download some of QuantConnect's data for local usage, see <a href="/docs/v2/lean-cli/datasets/downloading-quantconnect-data">Downloading QuantConnect Data</a>.
