    A cloud-focused workflow (local development, cloud execution) with the CLI might look like this:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>Open a terminal in the directory you ran <code>lean init</code> in.</li>
    <li>Run <code>lean cloud pull</code> to pull remotely changed files.</li>
    <li>Start programming locally and run backtests in the cloud with <code>lean cloud backtest "&lt;projectName&gt;" --open --push</code> whenever there is something to backtest. The <code>--open</code> flag means that the backtest results are opened in the browser when done, while the <code>--push</code> flag means that local changes are pushed to the cloud before running the backtest.</li>
    <li>Whenever you want to create a new project, run <code>lean create-project "&lt;projectName&gt;" --push</code> and <code>lean cloud push --project "&lt;projectName&gt;"</code> to create a new project containing some basic code and to push it to the cloud.</li>
    <li>When you're finished for the moment, run <code>lean cloud push</code> to push all locally changed files to the cloud.</li>
</ol>

<p>
    The advantage of this workflow is that you can use all the tools in your local development environment to write your code (i.e. autocomplete, auto-formatting, etc.) while using QuantConnect's computing infrastructure and data when running your code.
    This advantage means you don't need to have a powerful computer and you don't need to have your own data, since that's all provided by us.
    The downside to this workflow is that you need a constant internet connection because without an internet connection the CLI can't communicate with the cloud.
