<p>
    If you find a bug in the local GUI, you can make it a lot easier for us to help you if you provide us with the recent logs of the local GUI.
    There are two types of logs, those of the front-end and those of the back-end.
    Depending on your issue you may find errors in either one or both of those.
</p>

<p>
    Follow these steps to get the logs of the front-end:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>Focus your browser window.</li>
    <li>Press <span class='key-combinations'>F12</span> to open the browser's developer console.</li>
    <li>Open the <span class='tab-name'>Console</span> tab in the developer console that opens to view the front-end logs.</li>
    <li>If you see any red messages (errors), take a screenshot of them and the surrounding messages. Feel free to mask any personal details that you don't want to share.</li>
</ol>

<p>
    Follow these steps to get the logs of the back-end:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>Open a terminal.</li>
    <li>Run <code>lean gui logs</code> to show the logs of the back-end.
<div class="cli section-example-container">
<pre>$ lean gui logs
The local server is running on http://localhost:5612/
&lt;-- GET /</pre>
</div>
    </li>
    <li>If you see any stack traces, please copy the lines containing the stack trace and the surrounding lines. Feel free to mask any personal details that you don't want to share.</li>
</ol>

<p>
    You can send these logs along with a description of the issue via the regular support channels.
