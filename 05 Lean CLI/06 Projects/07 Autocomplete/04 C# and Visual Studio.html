    Follow these steps to set up local autocomplete for C# in Visual Studio:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Make sure the .NET 5.0 Runtime is installed in the Visual Studio Installer by click <span class='button-name'>Modify</span> of the installed Visual Studio version and opening the <span class='tab-name'>Individual components</span> tab on the window that shows up.</li>
    <li>Click <span class='button-name'>Open a project or solution</span> on Visual Studio's home screen and open the <span class='private-file-name'>.csproj</span> file in one of the project directories generated by the CLI. Visual Studio automatically downloads the required dependencies and indexes them to provide autocomplete.</li>
    <li>Update your project to <a href="#07-Imports">include the required imports</a>.</li>
</ol>
