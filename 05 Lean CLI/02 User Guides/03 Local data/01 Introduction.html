<p>
    When you run a command like <code>lean backtest</code> or <code>lean optimize</code>, the CLI runs the LEAN engine in a Docker container locally.
    If the LEAN engine runs locally your local market data is used, which is the data stored in the <code>data/</code> directory generated by the <code>lean init</code> command.
    This page explains the structure of your local data directory and ways to source LEAN-compatible data.
