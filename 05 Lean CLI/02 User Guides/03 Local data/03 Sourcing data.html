    Sourcing LEAN-compatible data can be done in multiple different ways.
    In general we recommend you use the data from QuantConnect's <a href="https://www.quantconnect.com/data/tree" target="_blank">Data Library</a>.
    This data is curated and maintained by QuantConnect, and is easy to download <a href="/docs/v2/lean-cli/tutorials/local-data#03-Downloading-data-from-Data-Libraryhtml">through the CLI</a> or by <a href="/docs/v2/lean-cli/tutorials/local-data#04-Using-the-APIDataProviderhtml">using the APIDataProvider</a>.
    At the moment we provide Forex and CFD data for free, and in the future you'll also be able to purchase data for other asset types through QuantConnect.

    Alternatively, if you already have data of your own, you can convert it to a LEAN-compatible format yourself.
    In that case it is recommended that you read the <code>readme.md</code> files generated by the <code>lean init</code> command in the <code>data</code> directory, as these files contain up-to-date documentation on the expected format of the data files.

    For development purposes it is also possible to <a href="/docs/v2/lean-cli/tutorials/local-data#05-Generating-random-datahtml">generate data</a> using the CLI.
    This generator uses a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownian_model_of_financial_markets" target="_blank">Brownian motion model</a> to generate realistic market data, which may be helpful when you're testing strategies locally but don't have access to real market data.
