<p>
    Sourcing LEAN-compatible data can be done in multiple different ways.
    In general we recommend you use the data from QuantConnect's <a href="https://www.quantconnect.com/data/tree" target="_blank">Data Library</a>.
    This data is curated and maintained by QuantConnect and is easy to download <a href="/docs/v2/lean-cli/tutorials/local-data#03-Downloading-data-from-Data-Libraryhtml">with the CLI</a> or by <a href="/docs/v2/lean-cli/tutorials/local-data#04-Using-the-ApiDataProviderhtml">using the ApiDataProvider</a>.
    At the moment we provide Forex and CFD data for free, and in the future you'll also be able to purchase data for other asset types through QuantConnect.

<p>
    If you already have data of your own you can convert it to a LEAN-compatible format yourself.
    In that case we recommended that you read the <code>readme.md</code> files generated by the <code>lean init</code> command in the <code>data</code> directory, as these files contain up-to-date documentation on the expected format of the data files.

<p>
    For development purposes it is also possible to <a href="/docs/v2/lean-cli/tutorials/local-data#05-Generating-random-datahtml">generate data</a> using the CLI.
    This generator uses a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownian_model_of_financial_markets" target="_blank">Brownian motion model</a> to generate realistic market data, which may be helpful when you're testing strategies locally but don't have access to real market data.
