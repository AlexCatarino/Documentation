    You can configure the data directory to use in the <code>data-folder</code> property in your <a href="https://www.quantconnect.com/docs/v2/lean-cli/user-guides/configuration#03-Lean-configuration">Lean configuration file</a>.
    The path this property is set to is used as the data directory by all commands that run the LEAN engine locally.
    By default, this property points to the data directory generated by <code>lean init</code>.
    If this property is set to a relative path, it is resolved relative to the Lean configuration file's parent directory.

<p>
    The data directory is the only local directory that is mounted into all Docker containers ran by the CLI, so it must contain all the local files you want to read from your algorithms.
    You can get the path to this directory in your algorithm using the <code>Globals.DataFolder</code> variable.
