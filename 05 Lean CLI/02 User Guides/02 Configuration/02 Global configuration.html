<p>
    Global configuration is the place in which CLI defaults and API credentials are stored.
    The exact location of the global configuration files varies by operating system:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Windows: <code>C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\.lean</code></li>
    <li>macOS: <code>/Users/&lt;username&gt;/.lean</code></li>
    <li>Linux: <code>/home/&lt;username&gt;/.lean</code></li>
</ul>

<p>
    The global configuration is divided over three files, all of which are in JSON format:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><code>credentials</code>: this file contains the API credentials given via <code>lean login</code>.</li>
    <li><code>config</code>: this file contains the CLI defaults, like the default project language used when running <code>lean create-project</code>.</li>
    <li><code>cache</code>: this file contains an internal cache which the CLI uses whenever it needs to persistently store data. One of its uses is to store the last time an update check has ran to make sure we don't check for updates too often.</li>
</ul>
