<p>
    The Lean configuration contains the settings to use when running the LEAN engine locally.
    This configuration is created in the <code>lean.json</code> file when you run <code>lean init</code> in an empty directory.
    The configuration is stored as JSON, with support for both single-line and multiline comments.
</p>

<p>
    The Lean configuration file is based on the <a href="https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean/blob/master/Launcher/config.json" target="_blank">Launcher/config.json</a> file from the Lean repository.
    When you run <code>lean init</code> the latest version of this file is downloaded and stored on your local drive.
    Before the file is stored some properties are automatically removed because the CLI can set them automatically based on the command that you run or because the CLI saves the configuration somewhere else.
    This affects the following properties:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><code>environment</code>: this property is automatically set to <code>backtesting</code> when running a backtest or an optimization, or to the environment you provide to the CLI when starting local live trading.</li>
    <li><code>composer-dll-directory</code>: this property is automatically set to the right directory when running <code>lean research</code>.</li>
    <li><code>algorithm-type-name</code>, <code>algorithm-language</code> and <code>algorithm-location</code>: these properties are automatically set based on the project name you give to the CLI when running a backtest/optimization or when starting local live trading.</li>
    <li><code>debugging</code> and <code>debugging-method</code>: these properties are automatically set to the appropriate values when <a href="/docs/v2/lean-cli/tutorials/backtesting#03-Debugging-local-backtestshtml">debugging a local backtest</a>.</li>
    <li><code>job-user-id</code> and <code>api-access-token</code>: these properties are automatically set to the credentials provided via <code>lean login</code>.</li>
    <li><code>parameters</code>: this property is stored in the project configuration and automatically added to the Lean configuration when running the LEAN engine locally.</li>
</ul>
