<p>
    The Lean configuration contains settings for running the LEAN engine locally.
    This configuration is created in the <code>lean.json</code> file when you run <code>lean init</code> in an empty directory.
    The configuration is stored as JSON, with support for both single-line and multiline comments.
</p>

<p>
    The Lean configuration file is based on the <a href="https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean/blob/master/Launcher/config.json" target="_blank">Launcher/config.json</a> file from the Lean repository.
    When you run <code>lean init</code> the latest version of this file is downloaded and stored on your local drive.
    Before the file is stored, some properties are automatically removed because the CLI sets them automatically.
</p>

<p>
    One option in the Lean configuration file that deserves special attention is <code>data-folder</code>.
    This property must be set to the path of the local data directory, which is the directory containing the market data used when running LEAN locally.
    If this property is set to a relative path, it is resolved relative to the Lean configuration file's parent directory.
    The data directory is the only directory that is available in all Docker containers ran by the CLI, so it must contain all the local files you want to read from your algorithms.
    You can get the path to this directory in your algorithm using the <code>Globals.DataFolder</code> variable.
