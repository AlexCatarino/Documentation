<p>
    When running the <code>lean init</code>, <code>lean create-project</code>, or <code>lean cloud pull</code> commands the CLI scaffolds directories with useful files.
    These files include the local data directory, LEAN configuration, and everything most editors need to open your source code, provide autocomplete, and enable local debugging.
    This page documents exactly which files are created when running <code>lean init</code>, and when a project directory is created by <code>lean create-project</code> or <code>lean cloud pull</code>.
