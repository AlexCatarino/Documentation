<p>
    After installing the CLI and running <code>lean init</code> in an empty directory the CLI fills that directory with a standard directory structure.
    This structure contains everything the CLI needs to run the LEAN engine locally and everything most major editors need to open your source code.
    This page documents exactly which files are created and for what reason.
