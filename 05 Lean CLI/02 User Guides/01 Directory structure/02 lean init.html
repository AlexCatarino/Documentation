<p>
    After running <code>lean init</code> the following structure is created:
</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
<pre>.
├── data/
│   ├── alternative/
│   ├── cfd/
│   ├── crypto/
│   ├── equity/
│   ├── forex/
│   ├── futureoption/
│   ├── market-hours/
│   ├── option/
│   ├── symbol-properties/
│   └── readme.md
└── lean.json</pre>
</div>

<p>
    These files contain the following content:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><code>data/</code>: This directory contains the <a href="/docs/v2/lean-cli/user-guides/local-data">local data</a> that is used when running the LEAN engine locally. This directory is filled with <a href="https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean/tree/master/Data" target="_blank">sample data from the QuantConnect/Lean repository</a>.</li>
    <li><code>lean.json</code>: This file contains the <a href="/docs/v2/lean-cli/user-guides/configuration#03-Lean-configuration">Lean configuration</a> that is used when running the LEAN engine locally.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    We recommend running all Lean CLI commands in the same directory <code>lean init</code> was ran in.
    Doing so ensures the directory structure is always kept consistent when synchronizing projects between the cloud and your local drive.
    It also makes it possible for the CLI to automatically find the Lean configuration file when running the LEAN engine locally.
