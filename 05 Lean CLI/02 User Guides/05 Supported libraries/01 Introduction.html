    The Lean CLI supports using dozens of open source packages in your algorithms.
    These packages are reviewed by our security team, and when approved, can be used in backtesting, live trading, and research.
    To use these packages in your algorithm, you will need to add the relevant <code class="csharp">using</code><code class="python">import</code> statement at the top of your code file.

    The listings on this page display the installed libraries in the official LEAN Docker images.
