<p>
    Running  <code>lean cloud pull</code> downloads your cloud projects to your local drive.
    The CLI attempts to download each of them to the local directory matching the cloud project's path.
    If one of your cloud projects is named "My Strategy" and stored in the "Strategies" directory, the CLI attempts to download it to <code>./Strategies/My Strategy</code>.

<p>
    If you have two cloud projects with the same name, the first one is stored locally in <code>./&lt;project name&gt;</code>, and the second one is stored in <code>./&lt;project name&gt; 2</code>.

<p>
    After determining where to store the project, the CLI downloads the cloud project's files, its description, and its parameters to the local directory, potentially overwriting existing files and metadata.
    Local files which do not exist in the cloud are not deleted.
    After successfully pulling the cloud project's files and parameters, the cloud project's id is saved in the local directory's <a href="/docs/v2/lean-cli/user-guides/configuration#04-Project-configuration">config.json</a> file.
    This id ensures the CLI can find which cloud project is linked to the local project the next time you try to pull or push the project.
