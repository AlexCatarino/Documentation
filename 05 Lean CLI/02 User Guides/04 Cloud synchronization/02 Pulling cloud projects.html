<p>
    Running  <code>lean cloud pull</code> downloads your cloud projects to your local drive.
    The CLI attempts to download each of them to the local directory matching the cloud project's path.
    If one of your cloud projects is named "My Strategy" and stored in the "Strategies" directory, the CLI attempts to download it to <code>./Strategies/My Strategy</code>.

<p>
    The CLI downloads the cloud project if and only if the local directory does not exist yet or the <code>cloud-id</code> in the <a href="/docs/v2/lean-cli/user-guides/configuration#04-Project-configuration">config.json</a> file matches the cloud project's id.
    If these criteria are not met, a warning is shown to let you know what went wrong and the cloud project is not downloaded.
</p>

<p>
    When the required criteria are met, the CLI downloads the cloud project's files, its description, and its parameters to the local directory, potentially overwriting existing files and metadata.
    Local files which do not exist in the cloud are not deleted.
    After successfully pulling the cloud project's files and parameters, the cloud project's id is saved in the local directory's <a href="/docs/v2/lean-cli/user-guides/configuration#04-Project-configuration">config.json</a> file.
    This id ensures the CLI can find which cloud project is linked to the local project the next time you try to pull or push the project.
