<p>
    When you run <code>lean cloud pull</code> to download cloud projects to your local drive, the CLI will attempt to download each of them to the local directory matching the cloud project's path.
    If one of your cloud project is named "Logging" and stored in the "Library" directory, the CLI will attempt to download it to <code>./Library/Logging</code>.
    Before writing the cloud project's files to the local directory, the CLI performs a set of checks to make sure it doesn't accidentally overwrite the wrong files.
    To perform these checks the following information is gathered:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Whether the local directory for the cloud project exists or not.</li>
    <li>Whether the local directory contains a <a href="/docs/v2/lean-cli/user-guides/configuration#04-Project-configurationhtml">config.json</a> file with a <code>cloud-id</code> matching the cloud project's id.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    The CLI will only proceed with downloading the cloud project if and only if the local directory does not exist yet or the <code>cloud-id</code> in the <a href="/docs/v2/lean-cli/user-guides/configuration#04-Project-configurationhtml">config.json</a> file matches the cloud project's id.
    If these criteria are not met, a warning is shown to let you know exactly what went wrong and the cloud project is not downloaded.
</p>

<p>
    When the required criteria are met, the CLI will download all cloud project's files and parameters to the local directory, potentially overwriting existing files and parameters.
    Local files which do not exist in the cloud will not be deleted.
    After successfully pulling the cloud project's files and parameters, the cloud project's id is saved in the local directory's <a href="/docs/v2/lean-cli/user-guides/configuration#04-Project-configurationhtml">config.json</a> file.
    This ensures the CLI knows which cloud project is linked to the local project the next time you try to pull/push the project.
