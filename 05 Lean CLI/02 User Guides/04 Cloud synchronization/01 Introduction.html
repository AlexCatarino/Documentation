    One of the most useful features of the CLI is its ability to synchronize cloud projects with the local drive and vice-versa.
    This feature makes it possible to use your local development environment to work on projects hosted in the cloud, with easy synchronization between the two.
    This page describes how the <code>lean cloud pull</code> and <code>lean cloud push</code> commands determine where to pull/push files to and how potentially unwanted destructive actions are prevented.
