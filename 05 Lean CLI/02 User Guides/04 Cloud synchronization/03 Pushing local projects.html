<p>
    When you run <code>lean cloud push</code> to upload local files to the cloud, the CLI attempts to upload all local projects to the cloud while preserving the directory structure.
    If your local project is located in the <code>./Strategies/My Strategy</code> directory, the CLI attempts to upload it to a cloud project named "My Strategy" in a "Strategies" directory on QuantConnect.
</p>

<p>
    The CLI uploads the local files if and only if a cloud project with the same path as the local project does not exist yet or the cloud project has the same id as the <code>cloud-id</code> in the local project's <a href="/docs/v2/lean-cli/user-guides/configuration#04-Project-configurationhtml">config.json</a> file.
    If these criteria are not met, a warning is shown to let you know what went wrong and the local project is not uploaded.
</p>

<p>
    When the required criteria are met, the CLI uploads all the local project's files, its description, and its parameters to the cloud project with the same path.
    The cloud project is created for you if it does not exist yet and cloud files that do not exist locally are not deleted.
    After successfully pushing the local project's files and parameters, the id of the cloud project is stored in the local project's <a href="/docs/v2/lean-cli/user-guides/configuration#04-Project-configurationhtml">config.json</a> file.
    This id ensures the CLI can find which cloud project is linked to the local project the next time you try to pull or push the project.
