<p>
    When you run <code>lean cloud push</code> to upload local files to the cloud, the CLI will attempt to upload all local projects to the cloud while preserving the directory structure.
    If your local project is located in the <code>./Strategies/My Strategy</code> directory, the CLI will attempt to upload it to a cloud project named "My Strategy" in a "Strategies" directory on QuantConnect.
    Before any local files are uploaded to the cloud the CLI performs a set of checks to make sure it writes to the correct location.
    To perform these checks the following information is gathered:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Whether a cloud project with the path of the local directory exists or not.</li>
    <li>Whether the cloud project with the path of the local directory has the same id as the <code>cloud-id</code> stored in the local project's <a href="/docs/v2/lean-cli/user-guides/configuration#04-Project-configurationhtml">config.json</a> file (if it contains a <code>cloud-id</code>).</li>
</ul>

<p>
    The CLI will only proceed with uploading the local files if and only if a cloud project with the same path as the local project does not exist yet or the cloud project has the same id as the <code>cloud-id</code> in the local project's <a href="/docs/v2/lean-cli/user-guides/configuration#04-Project-configurationhtml">config.json</a> file.
    If these criteria are not met, a warning is shown to let you know exactly what went wrong and the local project is not uploaded.
</p>

<p>
    When the required criteria are met, the CLI will upload all local project files and parameters to the cloud project with the same path.
    The cloud project is created for you if it does not exist yet and cloud files which do not exist locally will not be deleted.
    After successfully pushing the local project's files and parameters, the id of the cloud project is stored in the local project's <a href="/docs/v2/lean-cli/user-guides/configuration#04-Project-configurationhtml">config.json</a> file.
    This ensures the CLI knows which cloud project is linked to the local project the next time you try to pull/push the project.
