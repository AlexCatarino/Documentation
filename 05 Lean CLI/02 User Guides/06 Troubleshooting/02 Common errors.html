                The command you tried to run does not exist or it doesn't support the option you provided.
                If the documentation says it is available you are probably using an outdated version of the CLI.
                Run <code>pip install --upgrade lean</code> to update to the latest version.

                You are trying to use a command which communicates with the QuantConnect API and you haven't authenticated yourself yet.
                Run <code>lean login</code> to log in with your API credentials.

            </td>
            <td>
                You are trying to use a command which needs to run the LEAN engine locally.
                This is done in a Docker container, which requires Docker to be installed and running.
                Make sure Docker is running if you installed it already, or visit <a href="/docs/v2/tutorials/installation/installing-docker">installing Docker</a> if you haven't.

            <td>
                This command should be executed in a Lean CLI project, run `lean init` in an empty directory to create one or specify the Lean configuration file to use with --lean-config
            </td>
            <td>
                The command you are trying to run requires a <a href="#">Lean configuration</a> file.
                The CLI will automatically try to find this by recursively looking in the current directory and all of the parent directories for a <code>lean.json</code> file.
                If no such file can be found, this error will be shown.
                It can be fixed by running the command in a directory you have previously executed <code>lean init</code> in (which generates the <code>lean.json</code> file), or by specifying the path to the <code>lean.json</code> file to use with the <code>--lean-config</code> option.
