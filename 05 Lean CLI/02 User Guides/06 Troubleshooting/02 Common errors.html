                The command you tried to run does not exist or it doesn't support the option you provided.
                If the documentation says it is available you are probably using an outdated version of the CLI.
                Run <code>pip install --upgrade lean</code> to update to the latest version.

            </td>
            <td>
                You are trying to use a command which communicates with the QuantConnect API and you haven't authenticated yourself yet.
                Run <code>lean login</code> to log in with your API credentials.

            </td>
            <td>
                You are trying to use a command which needs to run the LEAN engine locally, which always happens in a Docker container.
                Make sure Docker is running if you installed it already, or visit <a href="/docs/v2/lean-cli/tutorials/installation/installing-docker">Installing Docker</a> if you haven't.

        <tr>
            <td>
                This command requires a Lean configuration file, run `lean init` in an empty directory to create one, or specify the file to use with --lean-config
            </td>
            <td>
                The command you are trying to run requires a <a href="/docs/v2/lean-cli/user-guides/configuration#03-Lean-configuration">Lean configuration</a> file.
                The CLI automatically tries to find this file by recursively looking in the current directory and all of the parent directories for a <code>lean.json</code> file.
                This error is shown if no such file can be found.
                It can be fixed by running the command in a directory you have previously ran <code>lean init</code> in (which generates the <code>lean.json</code> file), or by specifying the path to the <code>lean.json</code> file with the <code>--lean-config</code> option.

                Invalid value for 'PROJECT': Path '&lt;path&gt;' does not exist.
            </td>
            <td>
                You are trying to run an action on a project but specified an invalid project path.
                Make sure you are running the command from the directory in which you ran <code>lean init</code> and make sure <code>./&lt;path&gt;</code> points to an existing directory.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                '&lt;path&gt;' is not a valid path
            </td>
            <td>
                You provided a path which is not valid for your operating system.
                This error is most likely to appear on Windows, where the following characters are not allowed in path components: &lt;, &gt;, :, ", |, ?, and *.
                On top of those characters the following names are not allowed (case-insensitive): CON, PRN, AUX, NUL, COM1 until COM9, and LPT1 until LPT9.
                Last but not least, path components cannot end in a space or a dot on Windows.
