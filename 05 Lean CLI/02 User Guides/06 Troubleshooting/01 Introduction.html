<p>
    When using the CLI you might occassionally receive an error indicating that something went wrong.
    We try to provide accurate error descriptions in the CLI, but in some cases those might not be enough.
    This page lists common errors with their possible cause and a way to fix them.
    In case you still need help after that this page also contains instructions on how to report issues to our engineers in a way that makes it easier for us to help you with your issue.
