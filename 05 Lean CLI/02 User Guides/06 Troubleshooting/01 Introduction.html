<p>
    When using the CLI you may occassionally receive an error indicating that something went wrong.
    We try to provide accurate error descriptions in the CLI, but in some cases those may not be enough.
    This page contains a list of common errors with their possible causes.
    If with the information in that list you're still having issues this page also contains instructions on how to report issues to our engineers in a way that makes it easier for us to figure out what's going wrong.
