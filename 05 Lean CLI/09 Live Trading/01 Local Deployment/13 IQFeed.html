    Instead of using the data feed from your brokerage, you can also use IQFeed if you're on Windows.
    Using IQFeed requires you to have an IQFeed developer account and you need to have the IQFeed client installed locally.
    Follow these steps after selecting IQFeed as your data feed in the <a href="#01-Introduction">tutorial in the introduction</a>:

    <li>Enter the path to the IQConnect binary. The default path is <span class='private-file-name'>C:/Program Files (x86)/DTN/IQFeed/iqconnect.exe</span> if you used the default settings when installing the IQFeed client.
<div class="cli section-example-container">
<pre>$ lean live "My Project"
IQConnect binary location [C:/Program Files (x86)/DTN/IQFeed/iqconnect.exe]:</pre>
</div>
