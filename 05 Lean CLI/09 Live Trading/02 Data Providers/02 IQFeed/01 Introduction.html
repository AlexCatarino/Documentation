    Instead of using the data from your brokerage, you can also use IQFeed if you're on Windows.
    Using IQFeed requires you to have an IQFeed developer account and you need to have the IQFeed client installed locally. This tutorial demonstrates how to set up the IQFeed data provider with the QuantConnect Paper Trading brokerage.
