The recommended way to source local data is by purchasing and downloading it from our Dataset Market. This way, you can use the same data that is available to your algorithm when you run it in the cloud. There are two methods of downloading data. You can download smaller discrete datasets at a low cost or download complete collections in bulk to avoid selection bias.</p>",
