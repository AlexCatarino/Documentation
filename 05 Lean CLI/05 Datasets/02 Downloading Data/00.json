Seeking to disrupt a notoriously closed-source industry, QuantConnect takes a radically open-source approach to algorithmic trading. Through the QuantConnect web platform, more than 50,000 quants are served every month.</p><p>To locally run the LEAN engine, you need local data. We recommend you source local data from our <a href='https://www.quantconnect.com/datasets'>Dataset Market</a>, so you can use the same data that is available to your algorithm when you run it in the cloud. There are two methods of downloading data. You can download smaller discrete datasets at a low cost or download complete collections in bulk to avoid selection bias.</p>",
