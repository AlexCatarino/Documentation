We recommend you source local data from our <a href='https://www.quantconnect.com/datasets'>Dataset Market</a>, so you can use the same data that is available to your algorithm when you run it in the cloud. There are two methods of downloading data. You can download smaller discrete datasets at a low cost or download complete collections in bulk to avoid selection bias.</p>",
