    If you already have data of your own you can convert it to a LEAN-compatible format yourself.
    In that case, we recommend that you read the <span class='public-file-name'>readme.md</span> files generated by the <code>lean init</code> command in the <span class='public-directory-name'>data</span> directory, as these files contain up-to-date documentation on the expected format of the data files.

    For development purposes, it is also possible to <a href="/docs/v2/lean-cli/datasets/generating-random-data">generate data</a> using the CLI.
    This generator uses a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownian_model_of_financial_markets" target="_blank">Brownian motion model</a> to generate realistic market data, which might be helpful when you're testing strategies locally but don't have access to real market data.
