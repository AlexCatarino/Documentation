<p>This page describes how to calculate the approximate cost of downloading local data for algorithms of each asset class. The prices reflect the data prices at the time of writing. To view the current prices of each dataset, open a dataset listing in the <a href="https://www.quantconnect.com/datasets">Dataset Market</a> and then click the <span class="page-section-name">Pricing</span> tab. To download the data, use the <a href="/docs/v2/lean-cli/datasets/quantconnect/download-by-ticker/key-concepts#02-Using-the-CLI">lean data download</a> command or the <a href="/docs/v2/lean-cli/backtesting/deployment#04-Download-Datasets-During-Backtests">ApiDataProvider</a>.</p>
