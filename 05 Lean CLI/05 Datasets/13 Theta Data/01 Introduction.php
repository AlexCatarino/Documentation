    Instead of using the data from QuantConnect or your brokerage, you can use Theta Data if you're deploying a local project.
    This page explains our integration with their API and its functionality.
    To use Theta Data, you need to <a href='https://http-docs.thetadata.us/Articles/Getting-Started/Getting-Started.html' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>install and launch the Theta Terminal</a>.

<p>To view the implementation of the Theta Data integration, see the <a href='https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean.DataSource.ThetaData' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>Lean.DataSource.ThetaData repository</a>.</p>


<p>To use the CLI, you must be a member in an <a href='https://www.quantconnect.com/docs/v2/cloud-platform/organizations/tier-features'>organization</a> on a paid tier.</p>
