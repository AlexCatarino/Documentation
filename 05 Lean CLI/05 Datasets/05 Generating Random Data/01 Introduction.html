    Running the LEAN engine locally with the CLI requires you to have your own local data, but real market data can be expensive and governed by difficult redistribution licenses.
    Instead of using actual market data, you can also opt to use realistic fake data by using LEAN's random data generator.
    This generator uses a Brownian motion model to generate realistic market data.
    It is capable of generating data for most of LEAN's supported security types and resolutions, which makes it a good solution to design and test algorithms without the need to buy real financial data.
