<p>
	After you <a href='/docs/v2/lean-cli/installation/installing-lean-cli'>install the CLI</a>, you need to create an organization workspace. Your organization workspace connects a directory on your local machine with one of your <a href='/docs/v2/cloud-platform/organizations'>organizations</a> in QuantConnect Cloud. Your organization workspace includes the basic files and folders necessary to use LEAN, including a local data directory and a LEAN configuration file. 
</p>

<p>
    We recommend running all Lean CLI commands in your root of your organization workspace directory.
    Doing so ensures the directory structure is always kept consistent when synchronizing projects between the cloud and your local drive.
    It also makes it possible for the CLI to automatically find the Lean configuration file when you run the LEAN engine on your local machine.
