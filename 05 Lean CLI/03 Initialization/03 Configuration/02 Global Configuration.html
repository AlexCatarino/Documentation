<p>
    The global configuration is the place in which CLI defaults and API credentials are stored.
    The exact location of the global configuration files varies by operating system:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Windows: <code>C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\.lean</code></li>
    <li>macOS: <code>/Users/&lt;username&gt;/.lean</code></li>
    <li>Linux: <code>/home/&lt;username&gt;/.lean</code></li>
</ul>

<p>
    The global configuration is divided into three files and one directory:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><code>credentials</code>: This file contains the API credentials given via <code>lean login</code>.</li>
    <li><code>config</code>: This file contains the CLI defaults, like the default project language used when running <code>lean create-project</code>.</li>
    <li><code>cache</code>: This file contains an internal cache that the CLI uses whenever it needs to persistently store data. One of its uses is to store the last time an update check has run to make sure we don't check for updates too often.</li>
    <li><code>ssh</code>: This directory contains the SSH keys that are needed to debug over SSH when debugging with Rider.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    The global configuration files are always updated via the CLI and should not be updated or removed manually, unless when you are uninstalling the CLI.
