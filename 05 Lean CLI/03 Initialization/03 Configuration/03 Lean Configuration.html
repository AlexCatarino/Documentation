<p>
    The Lean configuration contains settings for running the LEAN engine locally.
    This configuration is created in the <span class="public-file-name">lean.json</span> file when you run <code>lean init</code> in an empty directory.
    The configuration is stored as JSON, with support for both single-line and multiline comments.
</p>

<p>
    The Lean configuration file is based on the <a class="public-file-name" href="https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean/blob/master/Launcher/config.json" target="_blank">Launcher / config.json</a> file from the Lean repository.
    When you run <code>lean init</code>, the latest version of this file is downloaded and stored on your local drive.
    Before the file is stored, some properties are automatically removed because the CLI sets them automatically.

    The settings are updated when you use the CLI. The following settings need to be updated directly in the <span class="public-file-name">lean.json</span> file:
