<p>
    The Lean configuration contains settings for running the LEAN engine locally.
    This configuration is created in the <span class="public-file-name">lean.json</span> file when you run <code>lean init</code> in an empty directory.
    The configuration is stored as JSON, with support for both single-line and multiline comments.
</p>

<p>
    The Lean configuration file is based on the <a class="public-file-name" href="https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean/blob/master/Launcher/config.json" target="_blank">Launcher / config.json</a> file from the Lean repository.
    When you run <code>lean init</code>, the latest version of this file is downloaded and stored on your local drive.
    Before the file is stored, some properties are automatically removed because the CLI sets them automatically.
</p>
<p>The CLI commands can update most of the values of the <span class="public-file-name">lean.json</span> file. The following table shows the configuration settings that you need to manually adjust in the <span class="public-file-name">lean.json</span> file if you want to change their values:</p>
