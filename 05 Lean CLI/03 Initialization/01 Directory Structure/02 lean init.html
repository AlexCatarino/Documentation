<p>
    After installing the CLI, open a terminal in an empty directory and run <code>lean init</code>.
    This command scaffolds a standard <a href="https://www.lean.io/docs/lean-cli/user-guides/directory-structure">directory structure</a> containing a data directory and a <a href="https://www.lean.io/docs/lean-cli/user-guides/configuration#03-Lean-configuration">Lean configuration file</a>, both of which are required to run the LEAN engine locally.
    We recommend running all Lean CLI commands in the same directory <code>lean init</code> was ran in.
</p>

<p>
    If you are running Docker on Windows using the legacy Hyper-V backend instead of the new WSL 2 backend, you also need to enable file sharing for your temporary directories and for the directory you ran <code>lean init</code> in.
    To do so, open your Docker settings, go to Resources &gt; File sharing and add <code>C:/Users/&lt;username&gt;/AppData/Local/Temp</code> and the directory you ran <code>lean init</code> in to the list.
    Click Apply & Restart after making the required changes.

<p>
    <code>lean init</code> creates the following structure:
</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
<pre>.
├── data/
│   ├── alternative/
│   ├── cfd/
│   ├── crypto/
│   ├── equity/
│   ├── forex/
│   ├── future/

│   ├── market-hours/
│   ├── option/
│   ├── symbol-properties/
│   └── readme.md
└── lean.json</pre>
</div>

<p>
    These files contain the following content:
</p>

<table class="qc-table table">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>File/Directory</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><span class='private-directory-name'>data/</span></td>
            <td>This directory contains the <a href="https://www.lean.io/docs/lean-cli/user-guides/local-data">local data</a> that is used when running the LEAN engine locally. This directory is filled with <a href="https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean/tree/master/Data" target="_blank">sample data from the QuantConnect/Lean repository</a>.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><span class='private-file-name'>lean.json</span></td>
            <td>This file contains the <a href="https://www.lean.io/docs/lean-cli/user-guides/configuration#03-Lean-configuration">Lean configuration</a> that is used when running the LEAN engine locally.</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>
    We recommend running all Lean CLI commands in the same directory <code>lean init</code> was ran in.
    Doing so ensures the directory structure is always kept consistent when synchronizing projects between the cloud and your local drive.
    It also makes it possible for the CLI to automatically find the Lean configuration file when running the LEAN engine locally.
