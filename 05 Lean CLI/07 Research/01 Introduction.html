<p>
    Starting local Jupyter Lab environments is a powerful feature of the Lean CLI.
    Jupyter Lab environments allow you to work on research notebooks locally.
    These environments contain the same features as <a href="https://www.quantconnect.com/docs/v2/research-environment">QuantConnect's research environment</a> but run on your local machine.

<p>To use the CLI, you must be a member in an <a href='https://www.quantconnect.com/docs/v2/cloud-platform/organizations/tier-features'>organization</a> on a paid tier.</p>
