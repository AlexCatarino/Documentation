Reconciliation is a way to <a href = "https://www.quantconnect.com/forum/discussion/7606/a-new-reconciliation-metric/p1">quantify</a> the difference between an algorithm's live performance and its out-of-sample (OOS) performance (a backtest run over the live deployment period).
</p>
<p>
Seeing the difference between live performance and OOS performance gives you a way to determine if the algorithm is making unrealistic assumptions, exploiting data differences, or merely exhibiting behavior that is impractical or impossible in live trading.
</p>
<p>A perfectly reconciled algorithm has an exact overlap between its live equity and OOS backtest curves. Any deviation means that the performance of the algorithm has differed for some reason. Several factors can contribute to this, often stemming from the algorithm design.</p>
