<p>Imagine that we've developed the following hypothesis: stocks that are below 1 standard deviation of their 30-day-mean are due to revert and increase in value, statistically around 85% chance if we assume the return series is stationary and the price series is a Random Process. We've developed the following code in research to pick out such stocks from a preselected basket of stocks.</p>
