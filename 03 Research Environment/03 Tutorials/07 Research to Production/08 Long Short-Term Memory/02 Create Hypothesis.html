<p>LSTM models have produced some great results when applied to time-series prediction. One of the central challenges with conventional time-series models is that, despite trying to account for trends or other non-stationary elements, it is almost impossible to truly predict an outlier like a recession, flash crash, liquidity crisis, etc. By having a long memory, LSTM models are better able to capture these difficult trends in the data without suffering from the level of overfitting a conventional model would need in order to capture the same data.

For a very basic application, we're hypothesizing LSTM can offer an accurate prediction in future price.</p>
