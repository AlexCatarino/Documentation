<p>In finance, we can often observe that 2 stocks with similar background and fundamentals (e.g. AAPL vs MSFT, SPY vs QQQ) move in similar manner. They could be correlated, although not necessary, but their price difference/sum (spread) is stationary. We call this cointegration. Thus, we could hypothesize that extreme spread could provide chance for arbitrage, just like a mean reversion of spread. This is known as pairs trading. Likewise, this could also be applied to more than 2 assets, this is known as statistical arbitrage.

However, although the fluctuation of the spread is stationary, the mean of the spread could be changing by time due to different reasons. Thus, it is important to update our expectation on the spread in order to go in and out of the market in time, as the profit margin of this type of short-window trading is tight. Kalman Filter could come in handy in this situation. We can consider it as an updater of the underlying return Markov Chain's expectation, while we're assuming the price series is a Random Process.

In this example, we're making a hypothesis on trading the spread on cointegrated assets is profitable. We'll be using forex pairs EURUSD, GBPUSD, USDCAD, USDHKD and USDJPY for this example, skipping the normalized price difference selection.</p>
