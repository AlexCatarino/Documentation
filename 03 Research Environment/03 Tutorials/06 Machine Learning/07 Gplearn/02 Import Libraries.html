<p>We'll need to import libraries to build the model and to split our data into training/testing sets. We also import pickle so we can store our model in ObjectStore later.</p>
<br/>
<p>Import the <code>sklearn</code> and <code>pickle</code> libraries by the following:</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
    <pre class="python">from sklearn.svm import SVR
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
import pickle</pre>
</div>
