<p>This page introduces how to use <code>Tensorflow</code> library in Python for machine learning model building, training, saving in the ObjectStore, and loading, through an example of predicting future prices.</p>
<br/>
<p>In this exmaple, we're using a multilayer-perceptron neural network to predict the 1-step forward close price by the previous 5 steps.</p>
