<p>We'll need to import libraries to build the model and to split our data into training/testing sets. We also import <code>joblib</code> so we can store our model in ObjectStore later.</p>

<p>Import the <code>xgboost</code>, <code>sklearn</code>, and <code>joblib</code> libraries by the following:</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
    <pre class="python">import xgboost as xgb
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
import joblib</pre>
</div>
