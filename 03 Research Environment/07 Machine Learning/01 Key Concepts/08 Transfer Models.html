<p>You can load machine learning models from the <a href='/docs/v2/research-environment/object-store/key-concepts'>Object Store</a> or a custom data file like pickle. If you train a model in the Research Environment, you can also save it into the Object Store to transfer it to the <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms'>backtesting and live trading environment</a>.</p>
