<p>We assume the market has only 2 regimes, and the market return is following Gaussian distribution. We are about to build a 2-component HMM model. This will be equivalent to a Gaussian mixture model with 2 means.</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
    <pre class="python"># Build the model.
model = hmm.GaussianHMM(n_components=2, covariance_type="full", n_iter=100)

# Fit the data into the model.
model.fit(X)</pre>
