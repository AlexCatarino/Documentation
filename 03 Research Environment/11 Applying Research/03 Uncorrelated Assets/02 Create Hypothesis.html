<p>According to Modern Portfolio Thoery, asset combinations with negative or very low correlation could have lower total portfolio variance given the same level of return. Thus, uncorrelated assets allows you to find a portfolio that will, theoretically, be more diversified and resilient to extreme market events. We're testing this statement in real life scenario, while hypothesizing a portfolio with uncorrelated assets could be a consistent portfolio. In this example, we'll compare the performance of 5-least-correlated-asset portfolio (proposed) and 5-most-correlated-asset portfolio (benchmark), both equal weighting.</p>
