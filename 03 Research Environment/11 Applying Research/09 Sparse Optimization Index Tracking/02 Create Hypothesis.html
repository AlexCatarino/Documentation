<p>Passive index fund portfolio managers will buy in corresponding weighting of stocks from an index's constituents. The main idea is allowing market participants to trade an index in a smaller cost. Their performance is measured by Tracking Error (TE), which is the standard deviation of the active return of the portfolio versus its benchmark index. The lower the TE means that the portfolio tracks the index very accurately and consistently.</p>

<p>A technique called Sparse Optimization comes into the screen as the portfolio managers want to cut their cost even lower by trading less frequently and with more liquid stocks. They select a desired group/all constituents from an index and try to strike a balance between the number of stocks in the portfolio and the TE, like the idea of L1/L2-normalization.</p>

<p>On the other hand, long-only active fund aimed to beat the benchmark index. Their performance are measured by the mean-adjusted tracking error, which also take the mean active return into account, so the better fund can be identified as consisitently beating the index by n%.</p>

<p>We can combine the 2 ideas. In this tutorial, we are about to generate our own active fund and try to use Sparse Optimization to beat QQQ. However, we need a new measure on active fund for this technique -- Downward Risk (DR). This is a measure just like the tracking error, but taking out the downward period of the index, i.e. we only want to model the index's upward return, but not downward loss. We would also, for a more robust regression, combining Huber function as our loss function. This is known as Huber Downward Risk (HDR).
