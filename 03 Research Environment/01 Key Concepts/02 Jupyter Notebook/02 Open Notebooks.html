<p>
A research notebook is created for every new project started in QuantConnect. However, you can create new notebooks by clicking Add New Notebook. You can access the default research notebook through the project file bar on the upper left-hand corner. Accessing the research notebook will spawn a new server which hosts the jupyter notebook you can analyze data on.
