Jupyter notebooks were created with the intention to support interactive data science and scientific computing across various programming languages. QuantConnect carries on that philosophy by providing an environment for you to perform exploratory research and brainstorm new ideas for algorithms.  A jupyter notebook installed in QuantConnect allows you to directly explore the massive amounts of data that are available in QuantConnect and analyze it with python or C# CLI commands. We call this exploratory notebook environment the Research environment.

The notebook allows you to run code in a safe and disposable environment. It is composed of independent cells where code can be edited and executed.

<p>
The notebook also allows you to provide descriptions of code with supplementary cells written in MarkDown.
</p>
<p>
You can create a new cell by first selecting an existing cell and then using the <i>Insert Cell Below</i> button on the toolbar. 
</p>
<p>
Each cell can be edited with either markdown or python code. You can choose which language to use in the drop-down list in the toolbar.
</p>
<p>
To run an individual cell, you must first select that cell and then click the <i>Run</i> button on the toolbar.
