Jupyter notebooks were created with the intention to support interactive data science and scientific computing across various programming languages. QuantConnect carries on that philosophy by providing an environment for you to perform exploratory research and brainstorm new ideas for algorithms.  A jupyter notebook installed in QuantConnect allows you to directly explore the massive amounts of data that are available in QuantConnect and analyze it with python or C# CLI commands. We call this exploratory notebook environment the Research environment.
