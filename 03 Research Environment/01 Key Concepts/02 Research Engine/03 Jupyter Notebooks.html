Jupyter notebooks support interactive data science and scientific computing across various programming languages. We carry on that philosophy by providing an environment for you to perform exploratory research and brainstorm new ideas for algorithms.  A Jupyter notebook installed in QuantConnect allows you to directly explore the massive amounts of data that are available in QuantConnect and analyze it with python or C# CLI commands. We call this exploratory notebook environment the Research Environment. To open a notebook, open one of the <span class="public-file-name">.ipynb</span> files in your <a href="/docs/v2/our-platform/projects/project-management#02-View-All-Projects">cloud projects</a> or see <a href="/docs/v2/lean-cli/research#02-Running-Local-Research-Environment">Running Local Research Environment</a>.</p>

<p>The notebook allows you to run code in a safe and disposable environment. It's composed of independent cells where you can write, edit, and execute code. The notebooks support Python, C#, and Markdown code. <br></p>
