The backtesting environment is an event-based simulation of the market. Backtests aim to provide an accurate representation of whether a strategy would have performed well in the past, but they are generally slow and aren't the most efficient way to test the foundational ideas behind strategies. You should only use backtests to verify an idea after you have already tested it with statistical analysis.

The Research Environment lets you to build a strategy by starting with a central hypothesis about the market. For example, you might hypothesize that an increase in sunshine-hours will increase the production of oranges, which will lead to an increase in the supply of oranges and a decrease the price of Orange Juice Futures. You can attempt to confirm this working hypothesis by analyzing weather data, production of oranges data, and the price of Orange Juice futures. If the hypothesis is confirmed with a degree of statistical significance, you can be confident in the hypothesis and translate it into an algorithm you can backtest.
