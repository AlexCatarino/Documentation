<p>We've assumed the price data is a time series with some auto regressive property (i.e. its expectation is related to past price information). Therefore, by using past information, we could predict the next price level. One way to do so is by Random Forest Regression, which is a supervised machine learning algorithm where its weight and bias is decided in non-linear hyperdimension.</p>
