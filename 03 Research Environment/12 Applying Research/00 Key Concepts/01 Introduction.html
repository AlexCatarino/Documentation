The ultimate goal of research is to produce a strategy that you can backtest and eventually trade live. Once you've developed a hypothesis that you're confident in, you can start working towards exporting your research into backtesting. To export the code, you need to replace <code>QuantBook()</code> with <code>self</code> and replace the <a href="/docs/v2/research-environment/key-concepts/research-engine#04-Your-Research-and-LEAN">QuantBook methods</a> with their <code>QCAlgorithm</code> counterparts.</p>
