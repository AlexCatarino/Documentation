Imagine that you've developed the following hypothesis: stocks that are below 1 standard deviation of their 30-day mean are due to revert and increase in value. The following Research Environment code picks out such stocks from a preselected basket of stocks:
</p>


<div class="section-example-container">
	<pre class="python">import numpy as np
qb = QuantBook()

symbols = {}
assets = ["SHY", "TLT", "SHV", "TLH", "EDV", "BIL",
"SPTL", "TBT", "TMF", "TMV", "TBF", "VGSH", "VGIT",
"VGLT", "SCHO", "SCHR", "SPTS", "GOVT"]

for i in range(len(assets)):
    symbols[assets[i]] = qb.AddEquity(assets[i],Resolution.Minute).Symbol

# Fetch history on our universe
df = qb.History(qb.Securities.Keys, 30, Resolution.Daily)

# Make all of them into a single time index.
df = df.close.unstack(level=0)

# Calculate the truth value of the most recent price being less than 1 std away from the mean
classifier = df.le(df.mean().subtract(df.std())).tail(1)

# Get indexes of the True values
classifier_indexes = np.where(classifier)[1]

# Get the Symbols for the True values
classifier = classifier.transpose().iloc[classifier_indexes].index.values

# Get the std values for the True values (used for magnitude)
magnitude = df.std().transpose()[classifier_indexes].values

# Zip together to iterate over later
selected = zip(classifier, magnitude)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Once you are confident in your hypothesis, you can export this code into the backtesting environment. The algorithm will ultimately go long on the stocks that pass the classifier logic. One way to accommodate this model into a backtest is to create a <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/scheduled-events">Scheduled Event</a> that uses the model to pick stocks and place orders.
</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
	<pre class="python">def Initialize(self) -&gt; None:
    self.SetStartDate(2014, 1, 1)
    self.SetCash(1000000)
    self.SetBenchmark("SPY")
    
    self.SetPortfolioConstruction(EqualWeightingPortfolioConstructionModel())
    self.SetExecution(ImmediateExecutionModel())
    
    self.assets = ["IEF", "SHY", "TLT", "IEI", "SHV", "TLH", "EDV", "BIL",
                   "SPTL", "TBT", "TMF", "TMV", "TBF", "VGSH", "VGIT",
                   "VGLT", "SCHO", "SCHR", "SPTS", "GOVT"]
    
    self.symbols = {}
    
    # Add Equity ------------------------------------------------ 
    for i in range(len(self.assets)):
        self.symbols[self.assets[i]] = self.AddEquity(self.assets[i], Resolution.Minute).Symbol 
        
    # Set the Scheduled Event method
    self.Schedule.On(self.DateRules.Every(DayOfWeek.Monday), self.TimeRules.AfterMarketOpen("IEF", 1), self.EveryDayAfterMarketOpen)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Now that the <code>Initialize </code>method of the algorithm is set, export the model into the Scheduled Event method. You just need to switch <code>qb</code> with <code>self</code> and replace <code>QuantBook </code>methods with their <code>QCAlgorithm </code>counterparts. In this example, you don't need to switch any methods because the model only uses methods that exist in <code>QCAlgorithm</code>.
</p>


<div class="section-example-container">
	<pre class="python">def EveryDayAfterMarketOpen(self):
    qb = self
    # Fetch history on our universe
    df = qb.History(qb.Securities.Keys, 5, Resolution.Daily)
    
    # Make all of them into a single time index.
    df = df.close.unstack(level=0)
    
    # Calculate the truth value of the most recent price being less than 1 std away from the mean
    classifier = df.le(df.mean().subtract(df.std())).tail(1)
    
    # Get indexes of the True values
    classifier_indexes = np.where(classifier)[1]
    
    # Get the Symbols for the True values
    classifier = classifier.transpose().iloc[classifier_indexes].index.values
    
    # Get the std values for the True values (used for magnitude)
    magnitude = df.std().transpose()[classifier_indexes].values
    
    # Zip together to iterate over later
    selected = zip(classifier, magnitude)
    
    # ==============================
    
    insights = []
    
    for symbol, magnitude in selected:
        insights.append(Insight.Price(symbol, timedelta(days=5), InsightDirection.Up, magnitude))
    
    self.EmitInsights(insights)
</pre>
</div>

<p>With the Research Environment model now in the backtesting environment, you can further analyze its performance with its <a href="/docs/v2/our-platform/backtesting/results">backtesting metrics</a>. If you are confident in the backtest, you can eventually live trade this strategy.</p>
