<p>Machine learning is a field of study that combines statistics and computer science to build intelligent systems that predict outcomes. Quant researchers commonly use machine learning models to optimize portfolios, make trading signals, and manage risk. These models can find relationships in datasets that humans struggle to find, are subtle, or are too complex. You can use machine learning techniques in your research notebooks.</p>
