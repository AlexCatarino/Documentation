<p>Keep in mind that in the research environment, all the data is directly available. While in backtesting, the available data is purposefully limited to the data at or before the agorithm time. This means that if we make a history request for the previous 10 days of data, in research we will receive the previous 10 days of data from today's date, while in backtesting we will receive the previous 10 days of data from the algorithm time. </p>
