The data from the history call is returned in a pandas dataframe. <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/">Pandas</a> is a python data manipulation and analysis framework. A pandas dataframe is a 2 dimensional labeled data structure, much like a spreadsheet or SQL table. A label on a row is called an Index and labels on columns are simply called columns.

<p class="csharp">
The data from the history call is returned in a IEnumerable&lt;Slice&gt; collection. 
</p>

<p>
In the example below, a history request is made for all securities that been subscribed to. <span class="csharp">The returned Slice collection contains attributes of Trade and Quote data available.</span><span class="python">The resulting data frame has columns for each data type returned; these data types correspond to components of the Trade data or the Quote data available. Notice that because <i>SPY</i> and <i>BTCUSD</i> do not have Quote data, they have <i>NaN</i> values for those columns.</span></p>
