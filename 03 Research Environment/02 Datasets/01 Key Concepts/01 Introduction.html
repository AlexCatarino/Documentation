The data that is accessible in backtesting is purposefully limited, so that you are prevented from looking into the future during the backtest simulation. However, in Research you can directly access all of the available data immediately. This includes Equities, Options, Forex, and Futures data going back as far as 1998. Similar to backtesting, the data is accessed by first subscribing to a security, <code>qb.AddEquity("SPY")</code>, and then making a history call, <code>qb.History("SPY", 10, Resolution.Daily)</code>.
