<p>In the Research Environment, all the historical data is directly available. In backtesting, you can only access the data that is at or before the algorithm time. If you make a history request for the previous 10 days of data in the Research Environment, you get the previous 10 days of data from today's date. If you request the same data in a backtest, you get the previous 10 days of data from the algorithm time. </p>
