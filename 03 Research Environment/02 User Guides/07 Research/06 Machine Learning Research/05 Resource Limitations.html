Training machine learning algorithms can be quite computationally expensive. There is a 10 minute limit on a time single loop in backtesting. This means that if we are training a model on a large dataset,  algorithm may time out. The <code>self.Train </code> method increases this limit to 30 minutes, allowing us more time to train our model.
