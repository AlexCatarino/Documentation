<div>What is gplearn:</div><div>- gplearn implements Genetic Programming in Python, with a scikit-learn 
inspired and compatible API. While Genetic Programming (GP) can be used 
to perform a very wide variety of tasks, gplearn is purposefully 
constrained to solving symbolic regression problems. This is motivated 
by the scikit-learn ethos, of having powerful estimators that are 
straight-forward to implement.</div><div>- Supported models: Symbolic Regressor, Symbolic Classifier, Symbolic Transformer</div><div>- Link to docs: https://gplearn.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro.html</div><div><br></div><div><div>Notebook &amp; backtest example:</div><div>&lt;link&gt;</div>&lt;image of plot from the notebook; click and it will load the notebook (hover alt text)&gt;</div><div></div>
