<div>What is PyTorch:</div><div>- PyTorch is a Python package that provides two high-level features: 
tensor computation (like NumPy) with strong GPU acceleration and deep 
neural networks built on a tape-based autograd system. You can reuse 
your favorite Python packages such as NumPy, SciPy, and Cython to extend
 PyTorch when needed. <br></div><div>- Supported models: https://pytorch.org/hub/research-models<br></div><div>- Link to docs: https://pytorch.org/</div><div><br></div><div><div>Notebook &amp; backtest example:</div><div>&lt;link&gt;</div>&lt;image of plot from the notebook; click and it will load the notebook (hover alt text)&gt;</div><div></div>
