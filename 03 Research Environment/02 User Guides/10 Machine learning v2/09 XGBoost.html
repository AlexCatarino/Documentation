<div>What is XGBoost:</div><div>- XGBoost is an optimized distributed gradient boosting library designed 
to be highly efficient, flexible and portable. It implements machine 
learning algorithms under the Gradient Boosting framework. XGBoost 
provides a parallel tree boosting (also known as GBDT, GBM) that solve 
many data science problems in a fast and accurate way. The same code 
runs on major distributed environment (Kubernetes, Hadoop, SGE, MPI, 
Dask) and can solve problems beyond billions of examples.</div><div>- Supported models: Gradient boosted regression/classification tree &amp; random forests</div><div>- Link to docs: https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/</div><div><br></div><div><div>Notebook &amp; backtest example:</div><div>&lt;link&gt;</div>&lt;image of plot from the notebook; click and it will load the notebook (hover alt text)&gt;</div><div></div>
