<div>What is Stable Baselines:</div><div>- Stable Baselines is a set of improved implementations of reinforcement 
learning algorithms based on OpenAI Baselines. These algorithms will 
make it easier for the research community and industry to replicate, 
refine, and identify new ideas, and will create good baselines to build 
projects on top of. We expect these tools will be used as a base around 
which new ideas can be added, and as a tool for comparing a new approach
 against existing ones. We also hope that the simplicity of these tools 
will allow beginners to experiment with a more advanced toolset, without
 being buried in implementation details.</div><div>- Supported models / RL algorithms: https://stable-baselines.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/algos.html<br></div><div>- Link to docs: https://stable-baselines.readthedocs.io/en/master/</div><div><br></div><div><div>Notebook &amp; backtest example:</div><div>&lt;link&gt;</div>&lt;image of plot from the notebook; click and it will load the notebook (hover alt text)&gt;</div><div></div>
