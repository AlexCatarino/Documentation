<p>
    The workspace directory initially has following structure:
</p>

<?php
include(DOCS_RESOURCES."/cli/init/structure.php"); 
$isCLIDocs = false;
$getStructureText($isCLIDocs);
?>

<p>As you add <a href='/docs/v2/drafts/local-laboratory/projects'>projects</a> to Local Lab, the project files are added to your workspace directory. If you create and use project libraries in your projects, the library files are added to a <span class='private-directory-name'>Library</span> directory in your workspace.</p>
