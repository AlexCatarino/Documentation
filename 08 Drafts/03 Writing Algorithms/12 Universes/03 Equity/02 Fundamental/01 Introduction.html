<p>A fundamental universe lets you select stocks based on corporate fundamental data. This data is powered by <a href="/datasets/morning-star-us-fundamentals">MorningstarÂ®</a> and includes approximately <?=$kpi["fundamental-universe-size"] ?> tickers with 900 properties each. Due to the sheer volume of information, fundamental selection is performed on the output of another universe filter. Think of this process as a 2-stage filter. An initial filter function selects a set of stocks and then a fine fundamental filter function selects a subset of those stocks.</p>
