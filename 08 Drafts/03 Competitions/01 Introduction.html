  The Open Quant League trading competition is an opportunity for university classes and clubs to showcase their quantitative trading skills. 
  It's a public competition where we share the live results of each team and grant prizes to the teams with the best quarterly performance.
  All teams that enter the competition receive the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Free credit to use QuantConnect.</li>
  <li>A platform to discuss their strategy logic with a public, permanent link to share on their LinkedIn profiles and resumes.</li>
  <li>Inbound inquiries from employers in the QC community looking for help on their algorithms or looking to hire talent for their fund.</li>
  <li>Public quarterly rankings page to share with potential employers via URL, including your discussion thread.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  In addition, all QC community members benefit from gaining access to the research from each university that participates. 
  The live algorithm the team contributed will become public so community members can use it to learn, trade, and improve.
