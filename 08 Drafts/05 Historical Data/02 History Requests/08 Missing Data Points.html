<p>There are several cases where you may get fewer data points from a history request that you expect.</p>

<h4>Illiquid Securities</h4>
<p>
  The default behavior for history requests is to fill-forward the data. 
  However, if an asset had no trading activity during the time period you request historical data for, you won't get any data for that asset.
</p>

<h4>Requesting Data Before an Asset's IPO</h4>
<p>
  All assets have a day when they first started trading.
  If you request historical data for an asset before their initial public offering (IPO) date, you won't get any data for that asset because the data doesn't exist.
</p>

<h4>Requesting Data Outside Market Hours</h4>
<p>
  History requests for a <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/historical-data/history-requests#02-Trailing-Data-Samples'>trailing number of data samples</a> return data based on the <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/securities/market-hours'>market hours</a> of assets, so they can wrap across multiple trading days to gather the amount of data you request.
  In contrast, history requests for <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/historical-data/history-requests#03-Trailing-Time-Periods'>trailing time periods</a> return data based on a rolling calendar time and history requests for specific <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/historical-data/history-requests#04-Date-Ranges'>date ranges</a> return data for whatever range you request.
  In these two types of history requests, if the period of time is outside of the market hours of an asset, you won't get any data.
