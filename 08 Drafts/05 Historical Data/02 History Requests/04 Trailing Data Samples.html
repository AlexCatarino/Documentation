  To get historical data for a trailing time period, call <code class='python'>history</code><code class='csharp'>History</code> method with an an integer and a <code>Resolution</code>. 
  For example, if you pass an asset <code>Symbol</code>, 5, and <code class='python'>Resolution.MINUTE</code><code class='csharp'>Resolution.Minute</code> as the arguments, it returns the data of the asset during the most recent 5 minutes of the asset's <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/securities/market-hours'>market hours</a>.
</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
    <pre class="csharp">// Get the minute-resolution TradeBar data of an asset over the trailing 5 minutes.
var history = History&lt;TradeBar&gt;(symbol, 5, Resolution.Minute);</pre>
    <pre class="python"># Get the minute-resolution TradeBar data of an asset over the trailing 5 minutes.
history = self.history(TradeBar, symbol, 5, Resolution.MINUTE)</pre>
</div>

<p>
  If there is no data for the time period you request, the result has less samples than you request.
  For instance, say an illiquid asset has no trading activity during the last 15 minutes of the trading day and you request the 10 most recent minute bars at market close, 4 PM Eastern Standard Time (ET). 
  In this case, you won't get any data because LEAN will try to fetch data from 3:50 PM ET to 4 PM ETF since the market was open during that time, but there were no trades for the asset.
