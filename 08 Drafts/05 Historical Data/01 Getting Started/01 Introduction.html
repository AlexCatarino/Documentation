<p>
  There are two ways to request historical data in your algorithms: direct <a href='/docs/v2/drafts/historical-data/history-requests'>historical data requests</a> and indirect <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/historical-data/warm-up-periods">algorithm warm up</a>. 
  History requests return all of the data you request as a single object.
  In contrast, warm-up simulates winding back the clock from the time you deploy the algorithm. In a backest, this is the <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/initialization#02-Set-Dates'>start date</a> of your algorithm. In live trading, it's the current date.
