<p>
  History requests from third-party data providers are much slower than from the QuantConnect data provider. 
  If you need data from a third-party data provider, request small amounts or your algorithm may take longer than 10 minutes to process and cause a timeout.
  For more information about the data providers, see their respective documentation in <a href='/docs/v2/cloud-platform/datasets'>Cloud Platform</a>, <a href='/docs/v2/local-platform/datasets/getting-started'>Local Platform</a>, or the <a href='/docs/v2/lean-cli/live-trading/data-providers'>CLI</a>.
