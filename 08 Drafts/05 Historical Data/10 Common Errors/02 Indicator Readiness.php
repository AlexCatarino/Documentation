<p>
  Indicators can't produce a valid value until they have enough historical data to be <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/indicators/key-concepts#07-Check-Readiness'>ready</a>.
  If your indicators require more data than what is currently available (for example, <a href='/docs/v2/drafts/historical-data/history-requests#08-Missing-Data-Points'>data before an asset's IPO</a>), the <code class='python'>indicator_history</code><code class='csharp'>IndicatorHistory</code> method will return fewer data points than you request and the warm-up techniques for <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/indicators/manual-indicators#06-Warm-Up-Indicators'>manual</a> and <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/indicators/automatic-indicators#08-Warm-Up-Indicators'>automatic indicators</a> won't be able to make your indicators ready.
