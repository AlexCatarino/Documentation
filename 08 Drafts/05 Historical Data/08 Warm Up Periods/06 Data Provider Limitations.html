<p>
  When you run warm-up, consider the functionality of the data provider you use.
  For example, the QuantConnect data provider has quotas on the amount of data you can request and the <a href='/docs/v2/cloud-platform/datasets/interactive-brokers'>Interactive Brokers data provider</a> can be slow, so it can timeout if you run warm-up with too many assets.
  For more information about all the data providers, see their respective documentation in <a href='/docs/v2/cloud-platform/datasets'>Cloud Platform</a>, <a href='/docs/v2/local-platform/datasets/getting-started'>Local Platform</a>, or the <a href='/docs/v2/lean-cli/live-trading/data-providers'>CLI</a>.
