  Warm-up and history requests both provide historical data.
  The approach you take depends on your specific use case.
  A benefit to using warm-up is that it only takes one line of code to pump historical data into your algorithm, which processes universe selection and updates all the indicators.
  A consequence to using warm-up is that it may provide more historica data than you actually need since it provides data on all the subscriptions in your algorithm. 
  If you have derivative assets in your algorithm, warm-up can be very slow to process.
