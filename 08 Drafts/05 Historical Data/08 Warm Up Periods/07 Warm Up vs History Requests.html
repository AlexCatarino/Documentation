  Warm-up and history requests both provide historical data.
  The approach you take depends on your specific use case.
  A benefit to using warm-up is that it only takes one line of code to pump historical data into your algorithm, which processes universe selection and updates all the indicators.
  A consequence to using warm-up is that it may provide more historica data than you actually need. 
  Furthermore, if you have derivative assets in your algorithm, warm-up can be very slow to process.
