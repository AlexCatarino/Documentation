<p>
When we use <code>qb.Indicator</code> to warm up an indicator, the indicator values are returned in a pandas dataframe. Because pandas dataframes allow plotting with the <code>df.plot()</code> method, it is straightforward to make simple plots of our indicators; 
</p>

<p>
Before we plot our indicator, we should filter out columns in the dataframe which are not relevant to our analysis. For our Bollinger Band indicator, we find that the standard deviation column contains much smaller values than the other columns. This may skew our charts when it scales to fit all the data. We can drop the standard deviation column from our dataframe before we plot it.
</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
	<pre class="all"># drop the standard deviation fields
df1_bb.drop('standarddeviation', 1)
</pre>
</div>

<p> insert figure </p>

Now that our indicator is ready for analysis, we can plot it.

<div class="section-example-container">
	<pre class="all"># plot the Bollinger Band
df1_bb.plot()
</pre>
</div>

<p> insert figure </p>
