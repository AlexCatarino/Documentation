<p>
Data from history calls is restricted to the default resolutions available for the given type of security, such as second, minute, hour, and daily resolutions. This means that when using <code>qb.Indicator</code>, the resolution of our indicators is also restricted to the default resolutions. If we want to create, for example a 5 minute resolution indicator, we will need to consolidate our minute resolution historical data into 5 minute data. You can learn how to consolidate data in a pandas dataframe in the <a href="https://www.quantconnect.com/docs/research-2/historical-data#Historical-Data-Consolidating-Historical-Data">Consolidating Historical Data</a> documentation. After consolidating our data, we will need to manually update our indicator with data from our consolidated dataframe and save those indicator values in a new dataframe.
