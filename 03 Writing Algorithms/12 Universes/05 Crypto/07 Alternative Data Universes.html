<p>An alternative data universe lets you select a basket of Cryptocurrencies based on an alternative dataset that's linked to them. If you use an alternative data universe, you limit your universe to only the securities in the dataset, which avoids unnecessary subscriptions. Currently, only the <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/datasets/coingecko/crypto-market-cap#10-Universe-Selection">Crypto Market Cap</a> alternative dataset supports universe selection for Crypto.</p>
