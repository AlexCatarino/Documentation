  Option price models compute the theoretical price of Option contracts, their implied volatility, and their Greek values. 
  Theoretical prices can help you detect undervalued and overvalued contracts, implied volatility can provide you insight into the upcoming volatility of the underlying security, and Greek values can help you hedge your portfolio.
