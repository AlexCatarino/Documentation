<p>When your universe adds and removes assets, LEAN notifies your algorithm through the <code class="csharp">OnSecuritiesChanged</code><code class="python">on_securities_changed</code> event handler. The event handler receives a <code>SecurityChanges</code> object, which contains references to the added and removed securities. To access the added securities, check the <code class="csharp">changes.AddedSecurities</code><code class="python">changes.added_securities</code> method property. To access the removed securities, check the <code class="csharp">changes.RemovedSecurities</code><code class="python">changes.removed_securities</code> method property.</p> 

<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="csharp">// Use the OnSecuritiesChanged method to know when an asset is added or removed.
public override void OnSecuritiesChanged(SecurityChanges changes)
{
    // Iterate through the added securities.
    foreach (var security in changes.AddedSecurities)
    {
        Debug($"{Time}: Added {security.Symbol}");
    }
    // Iterate through the removed securities.
    foreach (var security in changes.RemovedSecurities)
    {
        Debug($"{Time}: Removed {security.Symbol}");
        
        if (security.Invested)
        {
            Liquidate(security.Symbol, "Removed from Universe");
        }
    }

<p>The preceding example <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/trading-and-orders/liquidating-positions'>liquidates</a> securities that leave the universe. In this case, LEAN creates a <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/trading-and-orders/order-types/market-on-open-orders'>market on open order</a> and frees up buying power when the market opens.</p>
