<p>The universe manager tracks all the universes in your algorithm. If you add multiple universe, you can access the constituents of each individual universe. To access the constituents of a universe in a multi-universe algorithm, save references to each universe when you add them.</p>

 <div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="csharp">private Universe _universe;

// In the Initialize method, add a new universe.
UniverseSettings.Asynchronous = true;
_universe = AddUniverse(MyFundamentalFilterFunction);

// Use the UniverseManager to get information about the assets in each universe.
var universeMembers = UniverseManager[_universe.Configuration.Symbol].Members;
foreach (var kvp in universeMembers)
{
    var symbol = kvp.Key; // The symbol of the asset.
    var security = kvp.Value; // The security in the universe.
}</pre>
<pre class="python"># In the initialize method, add a new universe.
self.universe_settings.asynchronous = True
self._universe = self.add_universe(self._my_fundamental_filter_function)

# Use the universe_manager to get information about the assets in each universe.
universe_members = self.universe_manager[self._universe.configuration.symbol].members
for kvp in universe_members:
    symbol = kvp.key # The symbol of the asset.
    security = kvp.value # The security in the universe.</pre>
</div>

<p>
When you remove an asset from a universe, LEAN usually removes the security from the <code>Members</code> collection and removes the security subscription. 
However, it won't remove the security in any of the following situations: 
</p>
<ul>
    <li>You own the security.</li>
    <li>You have an open order for the security.</li>
    <li>The security wasn't in the universe long enough to meet the <code class="csharp">MinimumTimeInUniverse</code><code class="python">minimum_time_in_universe</code> setting.</li>
</ul>

<p>To get only the assets that are currently in the universe, see <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/universes/key-concepts#11-Selected-Securities'>Selected Securities</a>.</p>
