<p>In live trading, your brokerage charges an interest fee when you borrow shares to short a security. In backtesting, we don't currently simulate short interest fees. You can evaluate the borrowing cost with the <code class="csharp">FeeRate</code><code class="python">fee_rate</code> and <code class="csharp">RebateRate</code><code class="python">rebate_rate</code> methods.</p>
