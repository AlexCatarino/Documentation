<p>To short a security, you need to borrow shares from another investor or organization that owns the shares. A shortable provider is a model that tracks the number of shares that are available for you to borrow. A shortable provider can make your backtest results more realistic because it doesn't let you place a short trade if there are no shares available for you to borrow.</p>
