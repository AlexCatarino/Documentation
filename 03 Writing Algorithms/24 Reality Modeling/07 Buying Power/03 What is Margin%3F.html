  Margin is a credit loan from your brokerage you receive after you deposit collateral into your margin account. 
  You need margin to place short-biased trades and you can use margin to increase your buying power, but you incur interest fees. 
  <span class="new-term">Margin</span> is the dollar value of the loan that the brokerage gives you. 
  A <span class="new-term">margin requirement</span> of 25% means that to purchase $10,000 worth of securities, you need at least $2,500 worth of collateral in your brokerage account to open the trade and you can borrow the rest on margin. 
  <span class="new-term">Maintenance margin</span> is the minimum equity (equity = total portfolio value - borrowed funds) you must have in your brokerage account to stay in your positions. 
  If the value of your portfolio falls below the maintenance margin, you receive a <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/reality-modeling/margin-calls'>margin call</a>. 
  If you receive a margin call, you either need to add more capital to your brokerage account or the brokerage will liquidate some of your holdings to reduce your exposure and their risk.

  Some securities have special margin rules. 
  Derivatives are leveraged assets with a floating margin requirement. 
  In particular, long Options have zero maintenance margin requirement and their initial margin requirement is only the premium that you pay upfront.
