<p>The <code>BybitFutureMarginInterestRateModel</code> simulates the margin cost and payments of your Crypto Future holdings. When the funding rate is positive, the price of the perpetual contract is higher than the mark price, so traders who are long pay for short positions. Conversely, a negative funding rate indicates that perpetual prices are below the mark price, so traders who are short pay for long positions. The interest amount is </p>

<p>The interest amount is periodically credited or debited from your currency holdings while you hold open positions. The interest amount is charged at 12 AM, 8 AM, 4 PM in your <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/key-concepts/time-modeling/time-zones#04-Algorithm-Time-Zone'>algorithm time zone</a>.</p>
