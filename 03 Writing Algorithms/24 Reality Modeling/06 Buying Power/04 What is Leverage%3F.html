<p>Leverage is using borrowed money to increase your buying power. Leverage has an inverse relationship with your margin requirement and maintenance margin. If you have a margin requirement of 50%, you can use up to 1 / 50% = 2 leverage. Trading with leverage can be risky. It can boost your returns on profitable trades but can make your losing trades more expensive. If you have $10,000 in your brokerage margin account and purchase $20,000 worth of securities, you are trading with 2x leverage. If the value of the securities in your portfolio drops by 50% when you have a 2x leverage position, you lose all of your equity.</p>
