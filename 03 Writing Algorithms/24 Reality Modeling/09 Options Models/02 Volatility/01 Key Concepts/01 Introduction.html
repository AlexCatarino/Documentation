<p>Volatility models measure the historical volatility of an asset. They are mostly used to calculate the volatility of the underlying security of an Option because the implied volatility of an Option contract needs an initial guess. The historical volatility doesn't need to be the standard deviation of the asset prices. The various volatility models in LEAN each have a unique methodology to calculate volatility.</p>

    LEAN also provides an indicator implementation of implied volatility. 
    It provides higher flexibility on Option price model selection, <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/reality-modeling/options-models/pricing#97-What-Is-Volatility-Smile3F">volatility modeling</a>, and allows <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/reality-modeling/options-models/pricing#98-What-Is-Volatility-Smoothing3F">IV smoothing</a> through call-put pair.
