<p>There are several ways for you to get the Greeks and IV values, but you may notice some discrepancies between them.</p>

<h4>Greeks in Universe Selection</h4>
<p>
  The Greeks and IV values in the universe filter function are the daily, pre-calculated values based on the end of the previous trading day.
  You can't customize the Greeks and IV values that the filter function receives.
</p>

<h4>Greeks in Chain Requests</h4>
<p>
  The Greeks and IV values in the <code>OptionUniverse</code> objects that you get from calling the <code class='csharp'>OptionChain</code><code class='python'>option_chain</code> method are the daily, pre-calculated values based on the end of the previous trading day.
  You can't customize the Greeks and IV values that you get from this method.
</p>

<h4>Greeks in Data Events</h4>
<p>
  The Greeks and IV values in the <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/key-concepts/time-modeling/timeslices'>Slice</a> that you get in the <code class='csharp'>OnData</code><code class='python'>on_data</code> method are the values from the Option price model.
  To customize the Greeks and IV values in the <code>Slice</code>, set a different price model.
