<p>The default Option assignment model is the <code>DefaultOptionAssignmentModel</code>. The <code>DefaultOptionAssignmentModel</code> scans your portfolio every hour. It considers exercising American-style Options if they are within 4 days of their expiration and it considers exercising European-style Options on their day of expiration. If you have sold an Option that's 5% in-the-money and the Option exercise order is profitable after the cost of fees, this model exercises the Option.</p>
