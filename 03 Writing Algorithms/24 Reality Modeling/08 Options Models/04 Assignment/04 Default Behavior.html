<p>The default Option assignment model is the <code>DefaultOptionAssignmentModel</code>. The <code>DefaultOptionAssignmentModel</code> emulates exercising of short option positions in the portfolio by every hour: exercising American-style Options if they are within 4 days of their expiration, and exercising European-style Options on their day of expiration, if you have sold an Option that's 5% in-the-money and the Option exercise order is profitable after the cost of fees. To view the implementation of this model, see the <a rel='nofollow' target="_blank" href='https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean/blob/master/Common/Securities/Option/DefaultOptionAssignmentModel.cs'>LEAN GitHub repository</a>.</p>

<p>If you wish to disable automatic assignment, use <code>NullOptionAssignmentModel</code> to have no assignment at all.</p>
