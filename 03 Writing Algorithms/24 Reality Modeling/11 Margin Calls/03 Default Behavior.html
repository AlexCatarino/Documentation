<p>The brokerage model of your algorithm automatically sets the margin call model for the portfolio. The default brokerage model is the <code>DefaultBrokerageModel</code>, which sets the <code>DefaultMarginCallModel</code>. The <code>DefaultMarginCallModel</code> issues margin call warnings when the margin remaining in your portfolio is less than or equal to 5% of the total portfolio value. When a margin call occurs, this model sorts the generated margin call orders in ascending order by their unrealized profit and then executes each order synchronously until your portfolio is within the margin requirements.</p>
