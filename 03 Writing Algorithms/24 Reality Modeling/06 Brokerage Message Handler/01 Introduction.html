  When your brokerage sends a message, you receive this information in the algorithm and can take any actions. 
  When you place an order through your brokerage platform instead of placing it through LEAN, you can decide whether the transaction handler should process the order.
  By default, the transaction handler only process orders that you place through LEAN.
  Custom brokerage message handlers enable you to instruct the transaction handler to process orders that you create directly through your brokerage's platform.
