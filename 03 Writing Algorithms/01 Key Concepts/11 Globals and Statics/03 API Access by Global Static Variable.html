  Occasionally, accessing the QCAlgorithm object in your classes is impossible, and you need to use global static variables to access the API for debugging and initialization purposes. The most common case is custom data implementations where the LEAN Engine is creating the objects, and you're unable to specify a custom constructor.

  To successfully create a global static variable, you must assign the reference to the global variable in the algorithm's initialization. This sets the active instance of the variable to the global static. After this point, the global can access the QC Algorithm API.
