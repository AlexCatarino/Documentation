<p>LEAN is multi-threaded and attempts to consume as much CPU as possible to perform given work as quickly as possible. The analysis engine loads data parallel and synchronizes it to generate the requested security information.
</p>
<p>The client algorithm is plugged into LEAN, and has its events triggered synchronously in backtesting. The primary bottle neck to LEAN execution is simple executing client code.</p>
<p>In live trading, most events are synchronous as in backtesting, however order events are triggered when then happen directly from the brokerage thread (asynchronously) to ensure the lowest latency. For example; a strategy using hourly data, with a limit order could fill between data bars. This fill event is triggered when it occurs in live trading.

<p>We recommend using thread safe collections when possible, or semaphores to ensure collections are thread-safe.</p>
