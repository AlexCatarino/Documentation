<p>
The <code>OnData</code> method is the primary event handler for receiving financial data events to your algorithm. It is triggered sequentially at the point in time the data is available; in backtesting and live. For daily data this means the event is processed at midnight in backtesting or 6am the following day in live trading. 
</p>

<p>All data for a given moment of time is grouped in a single event, including custom data types. This data is passed with the Slice object.</p>

<p>When <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/securities/requesting-data#05-Fill-Forward">fill-forward</a> is enabled for your asset, the OnData event handler will be called regularly even if there was no new data. This is the default behavior.</p>

<p>If the handler takes a long time to process, events will be queued up and the next event will be triggered again immediately. In live trading it is important to ensure your event handlers process quickly. Perform intensive computation before the market opens with a <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/scheduled-events">Scheduled Event</a>, or a <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/machine-learning/training-models#02-Train-Models">Train</a> event. </p>
