<p>
  Log statements are strings recorded during a backtest that are best to record key decision moments. 
  Because backtests replay millions of data events, a log statement placed in the wrong place can generate gigabytes of logs which can be difficult to read. 
  Take care when placing the log to keep them readable.

<div class="section-example-container">
    <pre class="csharp">Debug($"Signal triggered. Placing limit order: {limit}");</pre>
    <pre class="python">self.debug(f"Signal triggered. Placing limit order: {limit}")</pre>
</div>
