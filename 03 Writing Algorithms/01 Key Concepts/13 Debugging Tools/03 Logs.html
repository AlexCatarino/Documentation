<p>
  Log statements are strings recorded during a backtest that are best to record key decision moments. 
  Because backtests replay millions of data events, a log statement placed in the wrong place can generate gigabytes of logs, which can be difficult to sift through. 
  Take care when placing the log to keep them readable.

<div class="section-example-container">
    <pre class="csharp">Log($"Signal triggered. Placing limit order: {limit}");</pre>
    <pre class="python">self.log(f"Signal triggered. Placing limit order: {limit}")</pre>
</div>

<p>Debug statements are the same as log statements, but <code class="csharp">Debug</code><code class="python">debug</code> method statements are orange in the Cloud Terminal to provide more emphasis.
Debug statements are streamed to the Cloud Terminal while the backtest is running. This can be helpful for real-time updates or monitoring in live-trading.</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
    <pre class="csharp">Debug($"Exposure to the {sectorName} sector is above 50%!");</pre>
    <pre class="python">self.debug("Exposure to the {sector_name} sector is above 50%!")</pre>
</div>
