  Even as quants, we still enjoy visualizing models to aid in understanding and debugging. 
  Plots help in identifying outliers in data.
  By plotting a signal value over time, you can understand its range or clearly see times when it generates invalid values. 
  You may want to apply intuition to plots as well, developing a theory about what you should see on a plot before you draw it and then confirming the theory. 
  For example, a plot of an asset's price standard deviations should be between -4 and +4, with any outliers happening during extreme market conditions such as during the COVID pandemic in March 2020.
  There is a powerful custom charting API in LEAN.
  It only takes one line of code to generate the plots.

<div class="section-example-container">
    <pre class="csharp">Plot("Deviations", "aapl", assetDeviation);</pre>
    <pre class="python">self.plot("Deviations", "aapl", asset_deviation)</pre>
</div>
