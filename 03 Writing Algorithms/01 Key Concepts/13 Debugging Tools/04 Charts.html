  Even as quants, we still enjoy visualizing models to aid in understanding and debugging. 
  Plots help in identifying outliers in data – by plotting a signal value over time you can understand its range or clearly see times when it generates invalid values. 
  You may want to apply intuition to plots as well – developing a theory about what you should see on a plot before you draw it, and then confirming the theory. 
  For example, a plot of an asset’s price standard deviations should be between -4 and +4, with any outliers happening during extreme market conditions such as during the COVID pandemic Mar-2020.
  In QuantConnect there is a powerful custom charting API. This can be accessed with a simple
