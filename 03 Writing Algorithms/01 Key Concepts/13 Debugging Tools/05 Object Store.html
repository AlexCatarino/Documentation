<p>
  The QuantConnect Object Store is a key-value data store for low-latency storage and retrieval of information. 
  During a backtest you can build large objects you’d like to analyze and write them for later analysis. 
  This can be helpful when the objects are large and plotting is impossible, or when you’d like to perform analysis across many backtests.
