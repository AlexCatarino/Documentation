  Debuggers pause program execution so you can inspect the state of variables or execute code snippets to test executions.
  The learn to start and operate the debugger, see the Debugging page in the <a href='/docs/v2/cloud-platform/backtesting/debugging'>Cloud Platform</a>, <a href='/docs/v2/local-platform/backtesting/debugging'>Local Platform</a>, or <a href='/docs/v2/lean-cli/backtesting/debugging'>CLI</a> documentation.
  Separate to general debugging, QuantConnect has a way to stream messages to the development environment during backtest. 
  This is a crude way to test signals are being triggered and to get a sense of your algorithms execution.
