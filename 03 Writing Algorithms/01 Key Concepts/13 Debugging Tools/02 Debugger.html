  The debugger is a built-in tool to help you debug coding errors while backtesting. 
  The debugger enables you to slow down the code execution, step through the program line-by-line, and inspect the variables to understand the internal state of the program.
  The learn how to start and operate the backtest debugger, see the Debugging page in the <a href='/docs/v2/cloud-platform/backtesting/debugging'>Cloud Platform</a>, <a href='/docs/v2/local-platform/backtesting/debugging'>Local Platform</a>, or <a href='/docs/v2/lean-cli/backtesting/debugging'>CLI</a> documentation.
