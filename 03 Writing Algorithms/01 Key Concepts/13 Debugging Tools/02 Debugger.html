  Debuggers pause program execution to inspect the state of variables, or execute code snippets to test executions.
  To trigger debugging in QuantConnect, you need to click the code-frame next to the line where youâ€™d like the program to pause, then press the backtest button with the small bug.
  Separate to general debugging, QuantConnect has a way to stream messages to the development environment during backtest. 
  This is a crude way to test signals are being triggered and get a sense of your algorithms execution.
