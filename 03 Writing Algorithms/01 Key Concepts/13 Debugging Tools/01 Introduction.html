  When your algorithm throws <a href='/docs/v2/cloud-platform/projects/debugging#02-Coding-Errors'>errors</a> or doesn't operate how you expect, use debugging tools to diagnose and resolve the issue.
  The tools to debug LEAN algorithms include a built-in debugger, logs, charts, and the Object Store.
