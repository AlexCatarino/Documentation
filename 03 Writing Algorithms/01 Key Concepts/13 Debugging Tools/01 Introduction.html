  Debugging should be your first step to understand errors in backtesting code execution. 
  Debuggers pause program execution to inspect the state of variables, or execute code snippets to test executions. 
  To trigger debugging in QuantConnect, you need to click the code-frame next to the line where youâ€™d like the program to pause, then press the backtest button with the small bug.
