<p>Bars have a start and end time that represent the time period of which the bar aggregates data. LEAN passes the bar to your algorithm at the end time so that you don't receive the bar before it was actually available. Free online data providers commonly timestamp their bars to the start time of the bar and include the bar close price, making your research prone to look ahead bias.</p> 

<p>Carefully consider the end-time of data to avoid one-off errors when you <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/importing-data/key-concepts'>import the data</a> into QC or compare indicator values across different platforms. Generally, bar timestamps can be represented as follows: <code>bar.EndTime = bar.Time + bar.Period</code>.</p>
