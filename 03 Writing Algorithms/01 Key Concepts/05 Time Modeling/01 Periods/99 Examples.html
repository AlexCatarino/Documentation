<p>The following examples demonstrate some common practices for period time modeling.</p>

<h4>Example 1: Tick Signal Daily Security Bar</h4>
<p>This example shows using a tick/pointwise signal from <a href="/datasets/smart-insider-corporate-buybacks">Smart Insider Intention</a> dataset to buy AAPL in daily resolution. You can count down the holding trade days per each AAPL trade bar received to liquidate the position after 2 trading days.</p>
