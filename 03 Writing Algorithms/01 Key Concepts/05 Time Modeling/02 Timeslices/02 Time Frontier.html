<p>If you request data for multiple securities and multiple resolutions, it can create a situation where one of your data subscriptions is ready to emit, but another subscription with a longer period is still be constructing its bar. Furthermore, if you request multiple datasets that have different time zones, your algorithm will receive the daily bars of each dataset at midnight in the respective time zone. To coordinate the data in these situations, we use the <code class="csharp">EndTime</code><code class="python">end_time</code> of each data point to signal when LEAN should transmit it to your algorithm.</p>

<p>Once your algorithm reaches the <code class="csharp">EndTime</code><code class="python">end_time</code> of a data point, LEAN sends the data to your <code class="csharp">OnData</code><code class="python">on_data</code> method. For bar data, this is the beginning of the next period. To avoid look-ahead bias, you can only access data from before this Time Frontier. The <code class="csharp">Time</code><code class="python">time</code> property of your algorithm is always equal to the Time Frontier.</p>
