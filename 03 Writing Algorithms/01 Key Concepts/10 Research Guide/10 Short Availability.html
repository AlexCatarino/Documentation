<p>To open a short position, you need to borrow shares from an investor or brokerage that owns them. Wang et al. (2014) show that some factors have a larger edge for long positions and some have a larger edge for short positions. Their research found that the factors that perform better on the short side usually target more securities that are on hard-to-borrow lists than factors that perform better on the long side. Their research also shows that a large part of the returns from these short-biased factors come from securities that are on hard-to-borrow lists. Therefore, if you don't account for short availability, your backtest results can be unrealistic and not reproducible in live trading.</p>

<p>To avoid issues with short availability, add a <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/reality-modeling/short-availability/key-concepts">shortable provider</a> to your algorithm. The shortable provider only lets you open a short trade if there are actually shares available to borrow. LEAN doesn't currently model the fees associated with short positions, but we have an open GitHub Issue to add the functionality.
