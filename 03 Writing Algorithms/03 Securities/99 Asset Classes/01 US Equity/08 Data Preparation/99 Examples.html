<h4>Example 1: Use Market On Open Orders</h4>
<p>In this example, we place an Market On Open order (MOO) to purchase 10 shares of SPY on July 1st, 2021 at 10:31 AM. The <code class="csharp">MarketOnOpenOrder</code><code class="python">market_on_open_order</code> method places a trade when the market open i.e. at 9:31 AM everyday. The fill model fills the order on July 2nd, 2021 at 9:31 AM at a price of $431.67, which is the official opening time for July 2nd, 2021.</p>
