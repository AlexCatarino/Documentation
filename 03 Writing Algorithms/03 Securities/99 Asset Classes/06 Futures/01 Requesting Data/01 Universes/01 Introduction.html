  The <code class="csharp">AddFuture</code><code class="python">add_future</code> method enables you to select a basket of Future contracts for an underlying Future.
  To form your universe of contracts, you can filter them down by their expiry.
  If you want to subscribe to individual contracts one-by-one instead of a set of contracts, see <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/securities/asset-classes/futures/requesting-data/individual-contracts'>Individual Contracts</a>.
