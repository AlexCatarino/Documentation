    As derivatives, Options are subject to a zero-sum game dynamic, necessitating counterparties to take opposing positions. 
    Consequently, it is essential to accurately determine the fair value of an Option to avoid potential disadvantages resulting from counterparties.
    It's possible to calculate the theoretical value of an Option using only its own terms and the underlying price series expectations.
</p>
$$
P = F(S_t, K, \sigma, T, r, q)
$$
<p>where $P$ is the Option price, $S_t$ is the current underlying price, $K$ is the strike price, $\sigma$ is the volatility, $T$ is the expiry, $r$ is the continuous interest rate, and $q$ is the continuous dividend yield.</p>

<p>With a correct <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/reality-modeling/options-models/pricing'>Option pricing model</a>, arbitrage traders capitalize on market inefficiencies, speculation traders can trade on the underlying price expectation or volatility, and risk/portfolio managers can hedge their positions to perfectly reduce risk exposure. The following sections describe popular Option pricing models.</p>
<h4>Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) Framework</h4>
<p>This framework operates on the assumption of a log-normal stochastic process governing underlying price dynamics. Its appeal stems from its continuous modeling approach and provision of closed-form analytical solutions, rendering it particularly amenable to real-world scenarios. Nevertheless, it has faced scrutiny for its reliance on assumptions of constant volatility and interest rates. It's primarily employed in the valuation of European Options, so utility wanes in situations where early exercise risk is significant.</p>
    
<h4>Lattice Models</h4>
<p>These encompass prevalent models such as the Binomial Tree and Trinomial Tree. Unlike the BSM model, lattice models adopt a discrete process framework lacking an analytical solution, necessitating numerical methods and substantial computational resources for the solution. However, they offer the advantage of facilitating the calculation of early exercise payoffs at each time step, making it a suitable tool on pricing American Options.</p>

<h4>Monte Carlo Simulation</h4>
<p>Particularly relevant for the pricing of exotic Options devoid of explicit analytical frameworks, Monte Carlo simulations serve as indispensable tools for estimating the expected fair Option prices. Despite their computational complexity and time-intensive nature, these simulations, including methods like Markov-Chain Monte Carlo, play a pivotal role in pricing certain Options.</p>
