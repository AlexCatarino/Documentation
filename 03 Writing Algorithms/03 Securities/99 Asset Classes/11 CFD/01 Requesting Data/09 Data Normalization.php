<p>
Interactive Brokers Stock CFDs apply corporate actions to the price of the asset, including paying dividends in cash to your account. This behavior is not modeled today and splits in live trading will result in price discontinuities. Algorithms should monitor the underlying equity contracts for events and use the underlying Equity contracts for indicators.
