  This page explains how to use the <code class="csharp">AddOption</code><code class="python">add_option</code> method to select a basket of Option contracts for an underlying Equity.
  You can filter the basket of contracts by their strike price and expiry or you can choose to select contracts that form popular <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/trading-and-orders/option-strategies'>Option strategies</a>.
  If you want to subscribe to individual contracts one-by-one instead of a set of contracts, see <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/securities/asset-classes/equity-options/requesting-data/individual-contracts'>Individual Contracts</a>.
