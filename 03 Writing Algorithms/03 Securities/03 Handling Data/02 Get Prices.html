    LEAN uses data updates to set the current prices of a security and compute the contribution of securities you hold to the portfolio value.
    To get the current prices of a security, find the <code>Security</code> object in the <code class="csharp">Securities</code><code class="python">securities</code> dictionary and access the price attributes.
</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
    <pre class="csharp">// Use the Securities object as a dictionary to get the current ask and bid price of the SPY.
var security = Securities["SPY"];
var price = security.Price;
var bidPrice = security.BidPrice;
var askPrice = security.AskPrice;</pre>
    <pre class="python"># Use the securities object as a dictionary to get the current ask and bid price of the SPY.
security = self.securities["SPY"]
price = security.price
bid_price = security.bid_price
ask_price = security.ask_price</pre>
</div>
