When the indicator is ready, the first value of the EMA is equivalent to the simple moving average. After the first EMA value, the EMA value is a function of the previous EMA value. Therefore, depending on the number of samples you feed into the indicator, it can provide different EMA values for a single security and lookback period. To make the indicator values consistent across time, warm up the indicator with all the trailing security price history.",
