        "description": "The Correlation Indicator is a valuable tool in technical analysis, designed to quantify the degree of relationship between the price movements of a target security (e.g., a stock or ETF) and a reference market index. It measures how closely the target\u2019s price changes are aligned with the fluctuations of the index over a specific period of time, providing insights into the target\u2019s susceptibility to market movements. A positive correlation indicates that the target tends to move in the same direction as the market index, while a negative correlation suggests an inverse relationship. A correlation close to 0 implies a weak or no linear relationship. Commonly, the SPX index is employed as the benchmark for the overall market when calculating correlation, ensuring a consistent and reliable reference point. This helps traders and investors make informed decisions regarding the risk and behavior of the target security in relation to market trends.",
