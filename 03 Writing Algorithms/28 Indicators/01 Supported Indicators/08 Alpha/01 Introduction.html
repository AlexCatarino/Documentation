<p>In financial analysis, the Alpha indicator is used to measure the performance of an investment (such as a stock or ETF) relative to a benchmark index, often representing the broader market. Alpha indicates the excess return of the investment compared to the return of the benchmark index. A positive Alpha implies that the investment has performed better than its benchmark index, while a negative Alpha indicates under performance. The S P 500 index is frequently used as a benchmark in Alpha calculations to represent the overall market performance. Alpha is an essential tool for investors to assess the active return on an investment and understand how well their investment is performing compared to the market average.</p>
