<p>In financial analysis, the Alpha indicator is used to measure the performance of an investment (such as a stock or ETF) relative to a benchmark index, often representing the broader market. Alpha indicates the excess return of the investment compared to the return of the benchmark index. The S P 500 index is frequently used as a benchmark in Alpha calculations to represent the overall market performance. Alpha is an essential tool for investors to understand the idiosyncratic returns of their investment that aren't caused by movement in the underlying benchmark.</p>
