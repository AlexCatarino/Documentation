<p>In technical analysis Beta indicator is used to measure volatility or risk of a target (ETF) relative to the overall risk (volatility) of the reference (market indexes). The Beta indicators compares target's price movement to the movements of the indexes over the same period of time. It is common practice to use the SPX index as a benchmark of the overall reference market when it comes to Beta calculations. The indicator only updates when both assets have a price for a time step. When a bar is missing for one of the assets, the indicator value fills forward to improve the accuracy of the indicator.</p>
