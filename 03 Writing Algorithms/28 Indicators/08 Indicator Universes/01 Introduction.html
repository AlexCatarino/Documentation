<p>An indicator universe uses technical indicators to determine the constituents of the universe. Imagine a universe that only contains assets above their 10-day simple moving average. You can incorporate indicators into any of the types of universes in the <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/universes/key-concepts">Universes chapter</a>. To create an indicator universe, define a helper class that contains the indicators and then define a universe that updates the indicators and selects assets.</p>
