<p>LEAN supports over 100 pre-built indicators, but a custom indicator is an indicator you define. It receives input, performs some calculation, and sets its output value. Custom indicators are helpful when you want to achieve any of the following results:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Use an indicator that LEAN doesn't currently implement</li>
    <li>Combine built-in indicators beyond the logic of <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/indicators/combining-indicators'>Indicator Extensions</a></li>
    <li>Create your own unique indicator for trading</li>
</ul>
