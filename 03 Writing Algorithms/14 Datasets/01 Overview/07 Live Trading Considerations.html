<p>We receive most daily alternative data at 7 AM Eastern Time (ET) and start processing it. In live trading, your algorithm receives this data within 30 minutes of 7 AM ET. In backtesting, this data has a timestamp of midnight, so your algorithm receives it about seven hours earlier than it does in live mode.</p>

<p>In backtests, your algorithm receives data at perfect timing. If you request minute resolution data, your algorithm receives the bars at the top of each minute. In live trading, bars have a slight delay, so you may receive them milliseconds after the top of each minute.</p>
