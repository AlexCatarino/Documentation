<p>The volume of the daily trade bars from this dataset is different from the daily volume that CME and other platforms like Yahoo Finance report because the CME includes pit trades in their daily volume calculation. In contrast, the volume of the daily trade bars in this dataset (from AlgoSeek) doesn't include pit trades because pit trades are over-the-counter, which algorithms can't trade.</p>

<p>Another discrepancy occurs from the start and end times of the daily bars. Daily bars from the CME and Yahoo Finance span from 5 PM Central Time (CT) to 4 PM CT on the following day. In contrast, QuantConnect consolidates daily bars from from 12 AM Eastern Time (ET) to 12 AM ET the following day. Therefore, to calculate the daily volume in the same way that CME does (excluding the pit trades), sum the volume of intraday bars that span 5 PM CT to 4 PM CT on the following day.
