<p>You can get historical universe data in an algorithm and in the Research Environment.</p>

<h4>Historical Universe Data in Algorithms</h4>
<p>To get historical universe data in an algorithm, call the <b>History</b> method with the <b>Universe</b> object, and the lookback period. If there is no data in the period you request, the history result is empty.</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
        <pre class="csharp">var history = History(_universe, 30, Resolution.Daily);
foreach (var constituents in history)
{
    foreach (ETFConstituentUniverse constituent in constituents)
    {
        Log($"{constituent.Symbol} weight at {constituent.EndTime}: {constituent.Weight}");
    }
}</pre>
     <pre class="python">history = self.History(self.universe, 30, Resolution.Daily)
for (universe_symbol, time), constituents in history.items():
    for constituent in constituents:
        self.Log(f'{constituent.Symbol} weight at {constituent.EndTime}: {constituent.Weight}')</pre>
</div>

<h4>Historical Universe Data in Research</h4>
<p>To get historical universe data in research, call the <b>UniverseHistory</b> method with the <b>Universe</b> object, and the lookback period. The <b>UniverseHistory</b> returns the filtered universe. If there is no data in the period you request, the history result is empty.</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
        <pre class="csharp">var universeHistory = qb.UniverseHistory(universe, qb.Time.AddDays(-30), qb.Time);
foreach (var constituents in universeHistory )
{
    foreach (ETFConstituentUniverse constituent in constituents)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"{constituent.Symbol} weight at {constituent.EndTime}: {constituent.Weight}");
    }
}</pre>
     <pre class="python">universe_history = qb.UniverseHistory(universe, qb.Time-timedelta(30), qb.Time)
for (universe_symbol, time), constituents in universe_history.items():
    for constituent in constituents:
        print(f"{constituent.Symbol} weight at {constituent.EndTime}: {constituent.Weight}")</pre>
</div>
