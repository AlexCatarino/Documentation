<p>The International Future Universe dataset by QuantConnect lists the available International Future contracts, their daily trading volume, and Open Interest. The data covers 4 contracts (DAX, FESX, HSI, and NKD), starts in July 1998, and is delivered on daily frequency. This dataset is created by monitoring the trading activity on the EUREX, HKFE, and CME.

<p>This dataset depends on the <a href='/datasets/quantconnect-us-futures-security-master'>US Futures Security Master</a> dataset because the US Futures Security Master dataset contains information on symbol changes of the contracts.</p>

<p>This dataset <code>does not</code> contain market data. For market data, see <a href="/datasets/tickdata-international-futures">International Futures by TickData</a> and <a href="/datasets/algoseek-us-future">US Futures by AlgoSeek</a> for NKD.</p>
