<p>The US Treasury Yield Curve dataset enables you to monitor the yields of bonds with numerous maturities in your strategies. Examples include the following strategies:</p>

<ul><li>Short selling SPY when the yield curve inverts</li>
<li>Buying short-term Treasuries and short selling long-term Treasuries when the yield curve becomes steeper (aka curve steepener trade)</li>
</ul>
<h4>Classic Algorithm Example</h4>
<p>The following example algorithm short sells SPY for two years when the yield curve inverts:</p>
