<p>The Upcoming Earnings dataset, provided by EOD Historical Data (EODHD), is a daily universe of US Equities with an earnings report publication in the upcoming 7 days. The data starts in January 1998 and is delivered on a daily frequency.</p>

<p>This dataset depends on the <a href="/datasets/algoseek-us-equities">US Equities by AlgoSeek</a> dataset because <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/universes/key-concepts#02-How-Universe-Selection-Works">universe selection</a> adds and removes market data subscriptions and on the <a href="/datasets/quantconnect-us-equity-security-master">US Equity Security Master</a> dataset because the US Equity Security Master dataset contains information on splits, dividends, and symbol changes.</p>
