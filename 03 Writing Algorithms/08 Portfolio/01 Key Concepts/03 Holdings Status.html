<p>You can identify a position as long- or short-biased based on the sign of the holding quantity. Long positions have a positive quantity and short positions have a negative quantity. The <code>SecurityHolding</code> object has the following properties to describe the holding status.</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
    <pre class="csharp">var holdings = Portfolio[_symbol];
var quantity = holdings.Quantity;
var invested = holdings.Invested;
var isLong = holdings.IsLong;
var isShort = holdings.IsShort;</pre>
    <pre class="python">holdings = self.portfolio[self._symbol]
quantity = holdings.quantity
invested = holdings.invested
is_long = holdings.is_long
is_short = holdings.is_short</pre>
</div>

<p>
    The quantity of <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/securities/asset-classes/crypto'>Cryptocurrencies</a> and <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/securities/asset-classes/crypto-futures'>Crypto Futures</a> can be lower than the minimum order size. 
    If the quantity is less than the lot size of the asset, the <code class="csharp">Invested</code><code class="python">invested</code> property is <code class="csharp">false</code><code class="python">False</code>.
