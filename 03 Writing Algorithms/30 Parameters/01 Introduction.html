<p>Parameters are project variables that your algorithm uses to define the value of internal variables like indicator arguments or the length of lookback windows. Parameters are stored outside of your algorithm code, but we inject the values of the parameters into your algorithm when you run a backtest, deploy a live algorithm, or launch an optimization job. To use parameters, set some parameters in your project and then load them into your algorithm.</p>
