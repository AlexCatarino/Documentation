<p>
  To get the <code>Symbol</code> objects of historical contracts, call the <code class='python'>future_chain_provider.get_future_contract_list</code><code class='csharp'>FutureChainProvider.GetFutureContractList</code> method with the continuous contract <code>Symbol</code> and a historical date.
  This method returns a list of <code>Symbol</code> objects that represent the contracts that were tradable between the historical date and the current day.
