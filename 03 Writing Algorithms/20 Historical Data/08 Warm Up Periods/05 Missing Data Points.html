<p>There are several cases where you may get fewer data points from during warm-up than you expect.</p>

<h4>Illiquid Securities</h4>
<p>
  The default behavior for LEAN is to fill-forward the data. 
  However, if an asset had no trading activity during the time period you request historical data for, you won't get any data for that asset.
</p>

<h4>Requesting Data Before an Asset's IPO</h4>
<p>
  All assets have a day when they first started trading.
  If your warm-up period includes time before an asset's initial public offering (IPO) date, you won't get any data before the IPO date because the data doesn't exist.
</p>

<h4>Requesting Data Outside Market Hours</h4>
<p>
  Warming up with a trailing number of data samples means the data is based on the <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/securities/market-hours'>market hours</a> of assets, so they can wrap across multiple trading days to gather the amount of data you request.
  In contrast, warming up with a trailing time period provides means the data is based on a rolling calendar time.
  In this latter types of warm-up, if the period of time is outside of the market hours of an asset, you won't get any data.
</p>

<h4>Data Issues</h4>
<p>
  Data issues are generally a result of human error or from mistakes in the data collection process.
  Any QuantConnect member can <a href='/docs/v2/cloud-platform/datasets/data-issues#04-Report-New-Issues'>report a data issue</a>, which our Data Team works to quickly resolve.
  However, while the data is still missing, your warm-up won't be able to provide the data.
