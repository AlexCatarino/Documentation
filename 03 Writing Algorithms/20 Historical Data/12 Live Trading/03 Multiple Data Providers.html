<p>
     When you deploy a live algorithm, you can add multiple data provider. 
     If you use multiple data providers, the order you select them in defines their order of precedence in Lean. 
     For example, if you set QuantConnect as the first provider and <a rel='nofollow' target='_blank' href='https://qnt.co/interactivebrokers'>Interactive Brokers (IB)</a> as the second provider, Lean only uses the IB data provider for securities that aren't available from the QuantConnect data provider. 
     This configuration makes it possible to use the QuantConnect data provider for Equity universe selection and then place Options trades on the securities in the universe.
