<p>
  History requests for a <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/historical-data/history-requests#02-Trailing-Data-Samples'>trailing number of data samples</a> return data based on the <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/securities/market-hours'>market hours</a> of assets.
  The default market hours for custom securities is to be always open.
  Therefore, history requests for a trailing number of data samples may return fewer samples than you expect.
  To set the market hours of the dataset, see <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/importing-data/streaming-data/custom-securities/key-concepts#12-Market-Hours'>Market Hours</a>.
