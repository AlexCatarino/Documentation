<p>Combo leg limit orders are individual orders that contain <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/trading-and-orders/order-types/limit-orders'>limit orders</a> for muliple securities. Combo leg limit orders are different from <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/trading-and-orders/order-types/combo-limit-orders'>combo limit orders</a> because you can create combo leg limit orders without forcing each leg to have the same limit price. Combo leg limit orders currently only work for trading Option contracts.</p>
