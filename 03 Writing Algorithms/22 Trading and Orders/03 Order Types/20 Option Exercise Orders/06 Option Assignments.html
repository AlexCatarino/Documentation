<p>If you sell an Option in a backtest, LEAN can simulate an Option exercise order on behalf of the buyer. By default, LEAN scans your portfolio ever hour. It considers exercising American-style Options if they are within 4 days of their expiration and it considers exercising European-style Options on their day of expiration. If you have sold an Option that's 5% in-the-money and the Option exercise order is profitable after the cost of fees, LEAN exercises the Option. For more information about how we simulate Option assignments, see the <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/reality-modeling/options-models/assignment'>Assignment</a> reality model.</p>
