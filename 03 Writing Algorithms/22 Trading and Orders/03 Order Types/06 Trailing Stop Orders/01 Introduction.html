<p>Trailing stop orders are <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/trading-and-orders/order-types/stop-market-orders">stop market orders</a> with a dynamic stop price. A sell trailing stop starts with the stop price at a fixed amount below the market price. As the market price rises, the stop price rises by the trail amount, but if the stock price falls, the stop loss price doesn't change. A buy trailing stop order starts with the stop price at a fixed amount above the market price. As the market price falls, the stop price falls by the trail amount, but if the stock price rises, the stop loss price doesn't change.</p>

<p>Trailing stop orders fill as a market order when the asset reaches the stop price. You can use trailing stop orders to buy breakouts or to mitigate the risk of large losses while protecting your gains. However, if the market gaps past your stop price, the order may fill at a worse price than the stop price you set. There's no guarantee that a trailing stop order fills at the stop price.</p>
