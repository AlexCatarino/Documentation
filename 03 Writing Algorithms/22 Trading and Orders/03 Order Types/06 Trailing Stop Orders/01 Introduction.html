<p>Trailing stop orders are <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/trading-and-orders/order-types/stop-market-orders">stop market orders</a> with a dynamic stop price. A sell trailing stop order sets the stop price at a fixed amount below the market price with an attached "trailing" amount. As the market price rises, the stop price rises by the trail amount, but if the stock price falls, the stop loss price doesn't change. A buy trailing stop order sets the stop price at a fixed amount above the market price with an attached "trailing" amount. As the market price falls, the stop price falls by the trail amount, but if the stock price rises, the stop loss price doesn't change. They fill as a market order when the asset reaches the stop price. You can use trailing stop orders to buy breakouts or to mitigate the risk of large losses while protecting your gains. However, if the market gaps past your stop price, the order may fill at a worse price than the stop price you set. There is no guarantee that a trailing stop order fills at the stop price.</p>
