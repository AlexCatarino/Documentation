A <span class="new-term">Box Spread</span> is the combination of a <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/trading-and-orders/option-strategies/bull-call-spread">bull call spread</a> and a <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/trading-and-orders/option-strategies/bear-put-spread">bear put spread</a>. It consist of buying an ITM call and an ITM put, while selling an OTM put and an OTM call with the same strike as the ITM call and ITM put respectively. This strategy serves as an delta-neutral arbitration from option mispricing. Note that it only attains a true profit when the risk-free return is greater than the risk free interest rate.
