A <span class="new-term">Short Box Spread</span> is the inverse of a <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/trading-and-orders/option-strategies/box-spread">box spread</a>, as well as the combination of a <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/trading-and-orders/option-strategies/bear-call-spread">bear call spread</a> and a <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/trading-and-orders/option-strategies/bull-put-spread">bull put spread</a>. It consist of shorting an ITM call and an ITM put, while buying an OTM put and an OTM call with the same strike as the ITM call and ITM put respectively. This strategy serves as an delta-neutral arbitration from option mispricing. Note that it only attains a true profit when the risk-free return is greater than the risk free interest rate.
