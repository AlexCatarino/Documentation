A <span class="new-term">Short Jelly Roll</span>, or simply <span class="new-term">Short Roll</span>, is a combination of a <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/trading-and-orders/option-strategies/short-call-calendar-spread">short call calendar spread</a> and a <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/trading-and-orders/option-strategies/long-put-calendar-spread">long put calendar spread</a>.
It is the inverse of a <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/trading-and-orders/option-strategies/long-jelly-roll">jelly roll</a>.
It consist of selling a put and buying a call of the same expiry, as well as buying a put and selling a call with a further expiry, where all of the contracts have the same strike prices.
This strategy serves as an arbitrage on Option mispricing due to the temporary disparity between the call spread and the put spread synthetic portfolios.
