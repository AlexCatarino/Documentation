A <span class="new-term">Short Jelly Roll</span>, or simply <span class="new-term">Short Roll</span>, is the combination of a <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/trading-and-orders/option-strategies/short-call-calendar-spread">short call calendar spread</a> and a <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/trading-and-orders/option-strategies/long-put-calendar-spread">long put calendar spread</a>.  It is the inverse of a <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/trading-and-orders/option-strategies/jelly-roll">jelly roll</a>.
It consist of shorting a put and buying a call of the same expiry, as well as buying a put and shorting a call with a further expiry, where all of the contracts have the same strike prices.
This strategy serves as an arbitration from Option mispricing due to the temporary disparity between the call spread and the put spread synthetic portfolios. It is a delta-, gamma-, vega-, and theta-neutral strategy, but sensitive to rho (interest rate) and phi (dividend yield)
