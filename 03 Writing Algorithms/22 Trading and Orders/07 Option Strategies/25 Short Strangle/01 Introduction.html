<p><span class="new-term">Short Strangle</span> is an Options trading strategy that consists of simultaneously selling an OTM put and an OTM call, where both contracts have the same underlying asset and expiration date. By doing so, the trader is essentially betting that the underlying asset will remain relatively stable and not experience significant price movements before the Options' expiration.</p>
<p>Compared to a <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/trading-and-orders/option-strategies/short-straddle'>short straddle</a>, the net debit of a short strangle is lower since OTM Options are cheaper. Additionally, the winning range of a short straddle is wider and the strike spread is wider.</p>
