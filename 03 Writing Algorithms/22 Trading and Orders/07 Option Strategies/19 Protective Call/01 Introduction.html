<p>A <span class="new-term">Protective Call</span>&nbsp;consists of shorting a stock and buying call Options for the same amount of stock. The aim of the Protective Call is to hedge the short position of a stock by purchasing an ATM or slightly OTM Call Option. At any time for US Options or at expiration for European Options, if the stock moves below the strike price, the Option contract will expire and still maintain the underlying Equity position that you can close for a profit. If the underlying price moves above the strike, the Options contract will be exercised, the assigned underlying Equity will close the short position.</p>
