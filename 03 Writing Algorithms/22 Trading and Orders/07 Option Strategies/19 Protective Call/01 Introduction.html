<p>A <span class="new-term">Protective Call</span> consists of a short position in a stock and a long position in a call Option for the same amount of stock. Protective calls aim to hedge the short position of a stock with a long ATM or slightly OTM call Option. At any time for American Options or at expiration for European Options, if the stock moves below the strike price, the Option contract becomes worthless but the short position acquires an unrealized gain. If the underlying price moves above the strike, you can <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/trading-and-orders/order-types/option-exercise-orders'>exercise the Options contract</a> and receive the underlying Equity, which closes your short position.</p>
