<p><span class="new-term">Bull put ladder</span>, also known as <span class="new-term">short put ladder</span>, is the combination of a <a href="/docs/writing-algorithms/trading-and-orders/option-strategies/bull-put-spread">bull put spread</a> and an long short put with a lower strike price than the 2 legs of the put spread. All puts have the same underlying Equity and the same expiration date. This strategy profits from increasing volatility of the underlying asset, i.e. the underlying price moves away from its current price.</p>
