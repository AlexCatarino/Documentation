<p><span class="new-term">Bear put ladder</span>, also known as <span class="new-term">long put ladder</span>, is the combination of a <a href="/docs/writing-algorithms/trading-and-orders/option-strategies/bear-put-spread">bear put spread</a> and an extra short put with a lower strike price than the 2 legs of the put spread. All puts have the same underlying Equity and the same expiration date. This strategy profits from low volatility of the underlying asset, i.e. the underlying price stays similar at its current price.</p>
