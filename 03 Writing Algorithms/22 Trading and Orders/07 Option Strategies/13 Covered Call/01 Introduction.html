A <span class="new-term">Covered Call</span>&nbsp;consists of buying a stock and selling call Options for the same amount of stock. The aim of the Covered Call is to profit from the Option premium by selling calls written on the stock you already owned. At any time for US Options or at expiration for European Options, if the stock moves below the strike price, you keep the premium and still maintain the underlying Equity position. If the underlying price moves above the strike, the Options contract will be exercised and you will have to sell the stock at the strike price, but you will still keep the premium. Another risk of a Covered Call comes from the long stock position, whose value could drop.
