<p>
A <span class="new-term">Covered Call</span>&nbsp;consists of a long position in a stock and a short position in call Options for the same amount of stock. 
  Covered calls aim to profit from the Option premium by selling calls written on the stock you already own. 
  At any time for American Options or at expiration for European Options, if the stock moves below the strike price, you keep the premium and still maintain the underlying Equity position. 
  If the underlying price moves above the strike, you can <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/trading-and-orders/order-types/option-exercise-orders'>exercise the Options contract</a>, which means you sell your stock at the strike price and keep the premium. 
  Another risk of a covered call comes from the long stock position, which can drop in value.
