<p>A <span class="new-term">Naked Put</span>, also known as an <span class="new-term">uncovered put</span>, involves the sale of put Options without having a corresponding short position in the underlying security. It is called "naked" because the seller does not have any cover or protection in the form of a short position in the underlying asset, which exposes them to potentially unlimited risk. Naked puts aim to profit from the Option premium by selling puts. At any time for American Options or at expiration for European Options, if the stock moves above the strike price, you keep the premium. If the underlying price moves below the strike, the Option buyer can <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/trading-and-orders/order-types/option-exercise-orders'>exercise the Options contract</a>, which means you need sell the underlying at market price to fulfill your obligation to buy it at the strike price and keep the premium.</p>
