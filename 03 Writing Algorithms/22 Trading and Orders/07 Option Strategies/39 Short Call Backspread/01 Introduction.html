  <span class="new-term">Short Call Backspread</span>, consists of long 1 lower-strike call and short 2 higher strike calls.
  It is a combination of a <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/trading-and-orders/option-strategies/bull-call-spread">bull call spread</a> and a short call with the same strike price as the higher-strike leg the call spread. 
  All calls have the same underlying Equity and expiration date. 
  This strategy profits from stable, consistent price of the underlying asset. 
  For instance, the underlying price stays at its current price.
