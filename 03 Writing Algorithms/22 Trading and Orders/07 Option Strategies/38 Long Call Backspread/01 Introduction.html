  <span class="new-term">Long Call Backspread</span>, consists of short 1 lower-strike call and long 2 higher strike calls.
  It is a combination of a <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/trading-and-orders/option-strategies/bear-call-spread">bear call spread</a> and a long call with the same strike price as the higher-strike leg the call spread. 
  All calls have the same underlying Equity and expiration date. 
  This strategy profits from increasing volatility of the underlying asset. 
  For instance, the underlying price moves away from its current price.
