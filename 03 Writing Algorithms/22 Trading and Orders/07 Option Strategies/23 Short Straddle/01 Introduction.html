<p>A <span class="new-term">Short Straddle</span> consists of selling a call and a put, where both contracts have the same underlying asset, strike price (normally at-the-money), and expiration date. By doing so, the trader is essentially betting that the underlying asset will remain relatively stable and not experience significant price movements before the Options' expiration.</p>
