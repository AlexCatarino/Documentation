A long <span class="new-term">Jelly Roll</span>, or simply <span class="new-term">Roll</span>, is a combination of a <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/trading-and-orders/option-strategies/long-call-calendar-spread">long call calendar spread</a> and a <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/trading-and-orders/option-strategies/short-put-calendar-spread">short put calendar spread</a>. 
It consists of buying a put and selling a call of the same expiry, as well as buying a call and selling a put with a further expiry, where all of the contracts have the same strike price.
This strategy serves as an arbitrage on Option mispricing due to the temporary disparity between the call spread and the put spread synthetic portfolios.
