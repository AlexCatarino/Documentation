  <span class="new-term">Long Put Backspread</span>, consists of short 1 higher-strike put and long 2 lower-strike puts.
  It is a combination of a <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/trading-and-orders/option-strategies/bull-put-spread">bull put spread</a> and a long put with the same strike price as the lower-strike leg the put spread. 
  All puts have the same underlying Equity and expiration date. 
  This strategy profits from increasing volatility of the underlying asset. 
  For instance, the underlying price moves away from its current price.
