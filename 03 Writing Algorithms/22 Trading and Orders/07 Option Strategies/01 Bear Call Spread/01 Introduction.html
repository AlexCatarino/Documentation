<p><span class="new-term">Bear call spread</span>, also known as <span class="new-term">short call spread</span>, consists of selling an ITM call and buying an OTM call. Both calls have the same underlying Equity and the same expiration date. The ITM call serves as a hedge for the OTM call. The bear call spread profits from a drop in underlying asset price.</p>
