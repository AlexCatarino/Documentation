<p>A <span class="new-term">Covered Put</span>&nbsp;consists of selling a stock and selling put Options for the same amount of stock. The aim of the Covered Put is to profit from the Option premium by selling puts written on the stock you already shorted. At any time for US Options or at expiration for European Options, if the stock moves below the strike price, you keep the premium and still maintain the underlying Equity position. If the underlying price moves above the strike, the Options contract will be assigned and you will have to buy the stock at the strike price, but you will still keep the premium. Another risk of a Covered Put comes from the short stock position, whose value could increase.</p>
