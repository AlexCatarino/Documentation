<p>A <span class="new-term">Covered Put</span> consists of a short position in a stock and a short position in put Options for the same amount of stock. Covered puts aim to profit from the Option premium by selling puts written on the stock you already shorted. At any time for American Options or at expiration for European Options, if the stock moves below the strike price, you keep the premium and still maintain the underlying Equity position. If the underlying price moves above the strike, the Option buyer can <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/trading-and-orders/order-types/option-exercise-orders'>exercise the Options contract</a>, which mean you buy the stock at the strike price but you will still keep the premium. Another risk of a covered put comes from the short stock position, which can drop in value.</p>
