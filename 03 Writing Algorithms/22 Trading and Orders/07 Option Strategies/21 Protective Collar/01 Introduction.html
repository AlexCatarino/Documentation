<p>
A <span class="new-term">Protective Collar</span> is an Options strategy that consists of a <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/trading-and-orders/option-strategies/covered-call">covered call</a> and a long put (protective put) with a lower strike price than the short call contract. In contrast to the covered call, the protective put component limits the drawdown of the strategy when the underlying price decreases too much.
