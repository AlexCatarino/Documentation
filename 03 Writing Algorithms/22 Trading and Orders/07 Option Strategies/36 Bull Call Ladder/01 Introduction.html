<p><span class="new-term">Bull call ladder</span>, also known as <span class="new-term">long call ladder</span>, is the combination of a <a href="/docs/writing-algorithms/trading-and-orders/option-strategies/bull-call-spread">bull call spread</a> and an extra short call with a higher strike price than the 2 legs of the call spread. All calls have the same underlying Equity and the same expiration date. This strategy profits from low volatility of the underlying asset, i.e. the underlying price stays similar at its current price.</p>
