  <span class="new-term">Bull call ladder</span>, also known as <span class="new-term">long call ladder</span>, is a combination of a <a href="/docs/writing-algorithms/trading-and-orders/option-strategies/bull-call-spread">bull call spread</a> and a short call with a higher strike price than the 2 legs of the call spread. 
  All calls have the same underlying Equity and expiration date. 
  This strategy profits from low volatility of the underlying asset.
  For instance, the underlying price stays similar to its current price.
