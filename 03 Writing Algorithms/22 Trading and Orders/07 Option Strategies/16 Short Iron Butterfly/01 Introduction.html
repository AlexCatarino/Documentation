The <span class="new-term">Short Iron Butterfly</span> is an option strategy which involves four Option contracts. All the contracts have the same underlying stock and expiration, but the order of strike prices for the four contracts is $A&gt;B&gt;C$. The following table describes the strike price of each contract:</p>
<table class="table qc-table">
<thead>
<tr>
<th> Position</th>
<th>Strike</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1 OTM call</td>
<td> $A$</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>-1 ATM call</td>
<td> $B$</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>-1 ATM put</td>
<td> $B$</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1 OTM put</td>
<td> $C=B-(A-B)$</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>The short call butterfly consists of buying an OTM call, buying an OTM put, selling an ATM call, and selling an ATM put. This strategy profits from an increase in price movement (implied volatility) and from time decay value since ATM options decay sharper.</p>
