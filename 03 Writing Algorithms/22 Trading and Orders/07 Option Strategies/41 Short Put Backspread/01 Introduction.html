  <span class="new-term">Short Put Backspread</span>, consists of short 1 higher-strike put and short 2 lower-strike puts.
  It is a combination of a <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/trading-and-orders/option-strategies/bear-put-spread">bear put spread</a> and a short put with the same strike price as the lower-strike leg the put spread. 
  All puts have the same underlying Equity and expiration date. 
  This strategy profits from stable, consistent price of the underlying asset. 
  For instance, the underlying price stays at its current price.
