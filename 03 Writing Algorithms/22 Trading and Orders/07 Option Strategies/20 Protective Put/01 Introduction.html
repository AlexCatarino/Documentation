<p>A <span class="new-term">Protective Put</span>&nbsp;consists of buying a stock and buying put Options for the same amount of stock. The aim of the Protective Put is to hedge the long position of a stock by purchasing an ATM or slightly OTM Put Option. At any time for US Options or at expiration for European Options, if the stock moves above the strike price, the Option contract will expire and still maintain the underlying Equity position that you can close for a profit. If the underlying price moves below the strike, the Options contract will be exercised, you will sell your underlying Equity at the Put Optoin strike price.</p>
