<p>A <span class="new-term">Protective Put</span> consists of buying a long position in a stock and a long position in put Options for the same amount of stock. Protective puts aim to hedge the long position of a stock with a long ATM or slightly OTM put Option. At any time for American Options or at expiration for European Options, if the stock moves above the strike price, the Option contract becomes worthless but the long stock position acquires an unrealized gain. If the underlying price moves below the strike, you can <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/trading-and-orders/order-types/option-exercise-orders'>exercise the Options contract</a>, which sells your underlying position at the put Option strike price.</p>
