<p>A <span class="new-term">Naked Call</span>, also known as an <span class="new-term">uncovered call</span>, involves the sale of call Options without owning the underlying asset. It is called "naked" because the seller does not have any cover or protection in the form of owning the underlying asset, which exposes them to potentially unlimited risk. Naked calls aim to profit from the Option premium by selling calls. At any time for American Options or at expiration for European Options, if the stock moves below the strike price, you keep the premium. If the underlying price moves above the strike, the Option buyer can <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/trading-and-orders/order-types/option-exercise-orders'>exercise the Options contract</a>, which means you need buy the underlying at market price to fulfill your obligation to sell it at the strike price and keep the premium.</p>
