<p>The <span class="new-term">Long Iron Condor</span> is an Option strategy that consists of four contracts. All the contracts have the same underlying Equity and expiration, but the order of strike prices is $A&gt;B&gt;C&gt;D$. The following table describes the strike prices of each contract:</p>

<table class="table qc-table">
<thead>
<tr>
<th> Position</th>
<th>Strike</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1 far-OTM call</td>
<td> $A$</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>-1 near-OTM call</td>
<td> $B$, where $B &gt; underlying\ price$</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>-1 near-OTM put</td>
<td> $C$, where $C &lt; underlying\ price$</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1 far-OTM put</td>
<td> $D$, where $C-D = A-B$</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>The long iron condor consists of buying a far OTM call, buying a far OTM put, selling a near ATM call, and selling a near ATM put. This strategy profits from an decrease in price movement (implied volatility) and time decay since ATM options decay sharper.</p>
