A <span class="new-term">Jelly Roll</span>, or simply <span class="new-term">Roll</span>, is the combination of a <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/trading-and-orders/option-strategies/long-call-calendar-spread">long call calendar spread</a> and a <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/trading-and-orders/option-strategies/short-put-calendar-spread">short put calendar spread</a>. 
It consist of buying a put and shorting a call of the same expiry, as well as shorting a put and buying a call with a further expiry, where all of the contracts have the same strike prices.
This strategy serves as an arbitration from Option mispricing due to the temporary disparity between the call spread and the put spread synthetic portfolios. It is a delta-, gamma-, vega-, and theta-neutral strategy, but sensitive to rho (interest rate) and phi (dividend yield)
