<div class="highlight">Warning: There is currently no <code>OptionStrategies</code> method for Iron Butterfly orders, so this tutorial manually orders the individual legs in the strategy. If you manually place multi-leg orders one at a time while there is no liquidity at a strike price, you can get stuck in an unhedged position.</div>

<p>
The <span class="new-term">Iron Butterfly</span> is an option strategy which involves four Option contracts. All the contracts have the same underlying stock and expiration, but the order of strike prices for the four contracts is $A&gt;B&gt;C$. The following table describes the strike price of each contract:</p>
<table class="table qc-table">
<thead>
<tr>
<th> Position</th>
<th>Strike</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>-1 OTM call</td>
<td> $A$</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1 ATM call</td>
<td> $B$</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1 ATM put</td>
<td> $B$</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>-1 OTM put</td>
<td> $C=B-(A-B)$</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>The long iron butterfly consists of selling an OTM call, selling an OTM put, buying an ATM call, and buying an ATM put. This strategy profits from a decrease in price movement (implied volatility).</p>
