  <span class="new-term">Bear call ladder</span>, also known as <span class="new-term">short call ladder</span>, is a combination of a <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/trading-and-orders/option-strategies/bear-call-spread">bear call spread</a> and a long call with a higher strike price than the 2 legs of the call spread. 
  All calls have the same underlying Equity and expiration date. 
  This strategy profits from increasing volatility of the underlying asset. 
  For instance, the underlying price moves away from its current price.
