<p>The <span class="new-term">Short Iron Condor</span> is an Option strategy that consists of four contracts. All the contracts have the same underlying Equity and expiration, but the order of strike prices is $A&gt;B&gt;C&gt;D$. The following table describes the strike prices of each contract:</p>

<table class="table qc-table">
<thead>
<tr>
<th> Position</th>
<th>Strike</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>-1 far-OTM call</td>
<td> $A$</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1 near-OTM call</td>
<td> $B, where B &gt; underlying\ price$</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1 near-OTM put</td>
<td> $C, where C &lt; underlying\ price$</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>-1 far-OTM put</td>
<td> $D, where C-D = A-B$</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The short iron condor consists of selling a far OTM call, selling a far OTM put, buying a near OTM call, and buying a near OTM put. This strategy profits from a increase in price movement (implied volatility).</p>
