<p>A <span class="new-term">Short Straddle</span> consists of selling a call and a put, where both contracts have the same underlying asset, strike price (normally at-the-money), and expiration date. If you enter a short straddle, you bet that the underlying asset will remain relatively stable and not experience significant price movements before the Option expires.</p>
