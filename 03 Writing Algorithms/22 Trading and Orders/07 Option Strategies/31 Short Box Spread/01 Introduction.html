A <span class="new-term">Short Box Spread</span> is the inverse of a <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/trading-and-orders/option-strategies/long-box-spread">box spread</a>, as well as the combination of a <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/trading-and-orders/option-strategies/bear-call-spread">bear call spread</a> and a <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/trading-and-orders/option-strategies/bull-put-spread">bull put spread</a>. 
It consists of buying an OTM call at strike $A$, selling an ITM put at strike $A$, buying an OTM put and strike $B < A$, and selling an ITM call at strike $B$, where all of the contracts have the same expiry date.
This strategy serves as an delta-neutral arbitration from Option mispricing. 
Note that it only attains a true profit when the risk-free return is greater than the <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/reality-modeling/risk-free-interest-rate/key-concepts'>risk-free interest rate</a>.
