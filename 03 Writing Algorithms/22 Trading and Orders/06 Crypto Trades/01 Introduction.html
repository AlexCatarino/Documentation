<p>All fiat and Crypto currencies are individual assets. When you buy a pair like BTCUSDT, you trade USDT for BTC. In this case, LEAN removes some USDT from your portfolio cash book and adds some BTC. The virtual pair BTCUSDT represents your position in the trade, but the virtual pair doesn't actually exist. It simply represents an open trade.</p>
