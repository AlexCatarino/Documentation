<p>To receive your custom data in the <code class="csharp">OnData</code><code class="python">on_data</code> method instead of in a bulk download, create a custom type and then create a data subscription. The custom data type tells LEAN where to get your data and how to read it. All custom data types must extend from <code class='csharp'>BaseData</code><code class='python'>PythonData</code> and override the <code>Reader</code> and <code>GetSource</code> methods.</p>

<p>Unlike custom data, native QC data gets the full benefit of security modeling like splits and dividends. Custom data is ignorant of everything about the actual market. Things like market hours, delistings, and mergers don't work with custom data.</p>
