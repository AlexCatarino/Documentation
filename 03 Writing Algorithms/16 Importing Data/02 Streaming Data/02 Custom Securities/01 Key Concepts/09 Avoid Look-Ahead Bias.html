<p>Look-ahead bias occurs when you make decisions with information that wouldn't be available until some time in the future. In backtesting, look-ahead bias occurs when you receive data earlier than it would actually be available in reality. If look-ahead bias seeps into your algorithm, it will perform differently between live trading and backtesting.</p>

<p>To avoid look-ahead bias, set the timestamp of data points to the time when the data would actually be available. A lot of external sources apply timestamps to data differently than we do. For instance, on some platforms, daily bars are displayed with the date that they opened. We display daily bars with the date they closed. If you set the <code class="csharp">EndTime</code><code class="python">end_time</code> to the start of the bar, you'll receive the bar earlier in backtests than you would in live trading.</p>
