<p>Common data formats are <span class="public-file-name">CSV</span>, <span class="public-file-name">JSON</span>, and <span class="public-file-name">XML</span>, but you can use any file type that can be read over the internet. For Excel files, double check the raw data format for parsing in the data reader, since data will be formatted for convenient visualization in Excel application view. To avoid confusion of data format, save the spreadsheet as a <span class="public-file-name">CSV</span> file and open it in a text editor to confirm the raw data format.</p>

<p>The data in the file must be in chronological order. If you import from a remote <a href=''>file provider</a>, each request has a one-second overhead, so package your custom data to minimize requests. Bundle dates together where possible to speed up execution. The Object Store file provider gives you the fastest execution because you don't need to download the files on every execution.</p>
