<p>There are two techniques to import data into your algorithm. You can either manually import the entire file or stream the file line-by-line into your algorithm's <code class="csharp">OnData</code><code class="python">on_data</code> event. This page explores importing an entire file for manual use.</p>

<p>Instead of downloading the file from a remote file provider, you can upload the file to the Object Store (with the <a href='/docs/v2/cloud-platform/organizations/object-store#03-Upload-Files'>Algorithm Lab</a> or with the <a href='/docs/v2/lean-cli/object-store'>CLI</a>) for faster execution.</p>
