  Walk forward optimization is the practice of periodically adjusting the logic or parameters of a strategy to optimize some objective function over a trailing window of time.
  For example, say your strategy is to hold a long position when an asset is trading above its <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/indicators/supported-indicators/simple-moving-average'>simple moving average</a> (SMA) and to hold a short position when it's trading below the SMA.
  If your objective is to maximize returns, how many trailing data points should you use to compute the SMA?
