<p>The following list provides some ideas on how you could use walk forward optimization:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Find the range of PE ratios that mazimize your algorithm's performance, and then use that range in your <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/universes/equity/fundamental-universes'>fundamental universe</a> filter.</li>
  <li>Experiment with asset universe diversity and counts.</li>
  <li>Take 10 <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/datasets/morningstar/us-fundamental-data'>fundamental factors</a> (PE, market cap, etc...). For each optimization session, step through and picks one factor at a time, using it as a ranking factor for the universe. Find the factor that leads to the greatest return over the lookback window and use it as the sole factor for the following month.</li>
</ol>
