<p>The following list provides some ideas on how you could use walk forward optimization:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Find the range of PE ratios that mazimize your algorithm's performance, and then use that range in your fundamental universe filter.</li>
  <li>Experiment with asset universe diversity and counts.</li>
  <li>Take 10 fundamental factors (PE, market cap, etc...). The WFO steps through and picks one at a time, using it as a ranking factor for the universe. The factor that leads to the greatest return over the lookback window is the sole factor for the following month.</li>
</ol>
