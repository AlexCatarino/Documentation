<p>Scheduled Events let you trigger code to run at specific times of day, regardless of your algorithm's data subscriptions. It's easier and more reliable to execute time-based events with Scheduled Events than checking the current algorithm time in the <code class="csharp">OnData</code><code class="python">on_data</code> event handler.</p>
