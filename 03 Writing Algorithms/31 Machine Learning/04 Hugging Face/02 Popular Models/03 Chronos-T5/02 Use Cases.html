  The Chronos-T5 model is a time series forecasting model. 
  The following use cases explain how you might utilize it in trading algorithms:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Forecast the future equity curves for a set of assets, then pass them to an optimizer to determine the weights that maximize the future Sharpe ratio of the portfolio.</li>
  <li>Forecast the future volatility of an asset to manage risk and opimize portfolio allocations.</li>
  <li>
    Train the model to forecast the impact of specific events on an asset and then adjust your holdings in response to the event. 
    For example, you could train the model to forecast the impact of <a href='/datasets/tiingo-news-feed'>news</a>, <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/securities/asset-classes/us-equity/corporate-actions'>corporate actions</a>, or <a href='/datasets/morning-star-us-fundamentals'>financial reports</a>.
  </li>
</ul>
