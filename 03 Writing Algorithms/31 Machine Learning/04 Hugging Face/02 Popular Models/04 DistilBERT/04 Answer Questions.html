Introduced on 2024-11-01. 
The legislation introduces a flat corporate income tax rate, reducing the current graduated system 
to 5.5% for taxable years starting from January 1, 2025, and further lowering it to 3.5% for years 
beginning January 1, 2026. It establishes a bonus depreciation deduction for qualified property and 
research expenditures, allowing immediate cost recovery. The bill also terminates various corporate 
tax credits, exemptions, and deductions, including those related to motion picture production, 
research and development, and historic structure rehabilitation, with most credits expiring after 
June 30, 2025. Additionally, it repeals provisions for certain tax programs and credits, such as the
corporate tax apportionment program and various incentives for businesses. The changes aim to simplify 
corporate taxation and reduce the number of available tax credits, with the new provisions effective 
for income tax periods starting January 1, 2025, and franchise tax periods beginning January 1, 2026. 
The legislation will take effect upon the governor's signature or after the designated period for 
gubernatorial action.
