  <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/algorithm-framework/execution/supported-models">Execution models</a> can place orders for your strategy instead of placing them manually. 
  LEAN routes <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/algorithm-framework/execution/key-concepts#05-Portfolio-Target-Collection">PortfolioTarget</a> objects to the <code class="csharp">Execute</code><code class="python">execute</code> method of the Execution Model to place orders.
</p>
<p>The following example uses a Framework Execution Model in a classic style algorithm:</p>
<div class="section-example-container">
	<pre class="csharp">// Use SetExecution to place orders via the Execution Model, which routes PortfolioTarget objects to its 
execute method, instead of placing orders manually. This ensures automated and consistent order execution.
public override void Initialize()
{
    // Execute the market order imediately to fill the portfolio targets.
    SetExecution(new ImmediateExecutionModel());
}</pre>
	<pre class="python"># Use set_execution to place orders via the Execution Model, which routes PortfolioTarget objects to its 
execute method, instead of placing orders manually. This ensures automated and consistent order execution.
def initialize(self):
    # Execute the market order imediately to fill the portfolio targets.
    self.set_execution(ImmediateExecutionModel())</pre>
</div>
