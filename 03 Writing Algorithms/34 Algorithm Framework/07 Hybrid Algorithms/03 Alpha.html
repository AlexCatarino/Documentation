<p>You can add one or multiple <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/algorithm-framework/alpha/key-concepts'>Alpha</a> models to your classic algorithm and place the orders using <code>Insight</code> objects without a Portfolio Construction model. To receive the collection of <code>Insight</code> objects in a classic algorithm, implement the <code class="csharp">InsightsGenerated</code><code class="python">insights_generated</code> event handler:</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
	<pre class="csharp">// Add one or multiple Alpha models to a classic algorithm allowing for direct trading based on generated Insight objects, bypassing the need for a Portfolio Construction model. 
public override void Initialize()
{
    AddAlpha(new EmaCrossAlphaModel());
    // The InsightsGenerated event handler is used to receive and process the collection of insights, facilitating flexible and dynamic trading strategies.
    InsightsGenerated += OnInsightsGenerated;
}
private void OnInsightsGenerated(IAlgorithm algorithm, GeneratedInsightsCollection insightsCollection)
{
    var insights = insightsCollection.Insights;
}</pre>
	<pre class="python"># Add one or multiple Alpha models to a classic algorithm allowing for direct trading based on generated Insight objects, bypassing the need for a Portfolio Construction model.
