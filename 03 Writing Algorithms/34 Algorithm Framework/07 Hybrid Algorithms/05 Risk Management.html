  Some Risk Management Models don't require a Portfolio Construction model to provide <code>PortfolioTarget</code> objects, allowing them to directly monitor the portfolio holdings and liquidate positions when neccessary. To see which pre-built Risk Management models don't need the Portfolio Construction model to provide <code>PortfolioTarget</code> objects, see <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/algorithm-framework/execution/supported-models">Supported Models</a>.
