<p>The <code>ETFConstituentsUniverseSelectionModel</code> selects a universe of US Equities based on the constituents of an ETF. These Universe Selection models rely on the <a href='/datasets/quantconnect-us-etf-constituents'>US ETF Constituents</a> dataset. They run on a daily schedule by default. To adjust the selection schedule, see <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/algorithm-framework/universe-selection/universe-settings#10-Schedule'>Schedule</a>.</p>
