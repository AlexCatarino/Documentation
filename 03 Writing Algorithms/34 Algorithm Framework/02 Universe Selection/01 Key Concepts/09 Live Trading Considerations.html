<p>In live trading, the securities in your brokerage account are added to your user-defined universe. If your Universe Selection model doesn't select these securities, they are not removed from your user-defined universe. When you liquidate the positions, you can remove them from the user-defined universe. If you call the <code class="csharp">RemoveSecurity</code><code class="python">remove_security</code> method, it automatically liquidates the position.</p>
