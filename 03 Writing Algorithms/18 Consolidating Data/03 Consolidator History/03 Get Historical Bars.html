<p>If you save consolidated bars in a <code>RollingWindow</code>, you can access them by indexing the <code>RollingWindow</code>. <code>RollingWindow</code> objects operate on a first-in, first-out process to allow for reverse list access semantics with positive and negative indexing. Index 0 refers to the most recent item in the window and the largest index refers to the last item in the window. Index -1 refers to the latest item as well.</p>
<div class="section-example-container">
	<pre class="csharp">var mostRecentBar = _window[0];
var previousBar = _window[1];
var oldestBar = _window[-1];</pre>
	<pre class="python">most_recent_bar = self._window[0]
previous_bar = self._window[1]
oldest_bar = self._window[-1]</pre>
</div></p>


<p>To get the consolidated bar that was most recently removed from the <code>RollingWindow</code>, use the <code class="csharp">MostRecentlyRemoved</code><code class="python">most_recently_removed</code> property.</p>
<div class="section-example-container">
	<pre class="csharp">var removedBar = _window.MostRecentlyRemoved;</pre>
	<pre class="python">removed_bar = self._window.most_recently_removed</pre>
</div>
