<p>
	Set up some live trading notifications so that you are notified of market events and your algorithm's performance. 
	QuantConnect Cloud supports email, SMS, webhooks, and Telegram notifications for live trading algorithms. 
	If you run local algorithm with LEAN or the LEAN CLI, the notification services aren't available. 
	To view the number of notification you can send for free in QuantConnect Cloud, see the <a href='/docs/v2/cloud-platform/organizations/resources#13-Live-Trading-Notification-Quotas'>Live Trading Notification Quotas</a>.
	Notifications are different from <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/live-trading/commands'>commands</a> because notifications enable you to send information out of your algorithm while commands enable you to manually call methods in your algorithm as it runs.
