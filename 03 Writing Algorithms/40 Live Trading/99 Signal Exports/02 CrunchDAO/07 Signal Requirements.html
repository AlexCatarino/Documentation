<p>When you submit signals to CrunchDAO, abide by the following rules:</p>

<ul>
    <li>All signals must have a quantity between 0 and 1 (inclusive).</li>
    <li>You can only submit one signal per round. If you submit more than one signal in a round, your previous submission is overwritten by the new one.</li>
</ul>
