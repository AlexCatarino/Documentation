  QuantConnect Signal Exports allows you to transmit the state of an algorithm's trading and portfolio positions to your fund or a third-party service.
  QuantConnect implements two signal services out of the box: <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/live-trading/signal-exports/collective2">Collective2</a> and  <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/live-trading/signal-exports/numerai">Numerai</a>.
  To send portfolio targets to your fund, you need to create a <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/live-trading/signal-exports/key-concepts#04-Provider-Structure">custom</a> Signal Export implementation.
