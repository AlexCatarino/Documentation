  Brokerage features and limitations are realistically modelled with Brokerage Models. 
  These reality models set the supported order and asset types for the brokerage. 
  To learn how to set your specific brokerage, see <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/reality-modeling/brokerages/supported-models">Supported Models</a>.
