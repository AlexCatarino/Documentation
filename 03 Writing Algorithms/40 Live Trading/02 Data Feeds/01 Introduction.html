<p>Data feeds are a stream of asset prices and quotes delivered to your trading algorithm during live execution. You need live data feeds to inject data into your algorithm so that you can make real-time trading decisions and so that the values of the securities in your portfolio update in real-time. You can source data from QuantConnect or your brokerage. To view the available data feeds, see <a href="/docs/v2/cloud-platform/live-trading/data-feeds">Data Feeds</a>.</p>
