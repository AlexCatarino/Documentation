    The live trading algorithm portfolio is loaded from the brokerage holdings, including open orders.
    When there are unsupported asset types in the portfolio the live trading strategy is stopped as we cannot be sure how to model the asset.

    Your algorithm should not assume it starts from an empty portfolio as you may have holdings from previous deployments.
