    There is no automatic state management of live strategies in QuantConnect. We recommend algorithms reconstruct state or indicator needs using the <a href="">WarmUp</a> and <a href="History">History</a> methods.
</p>
<p>
    Once the algorithm has warmed up some objects you can use the <a href="">Object Store</a> to save the data for the next algorithm restart.

    In the event the algorithm is terminated unexpectedly you should review the live algorithm portfolio at the brokerage to confirm it will behave as expected.
