<p>
    There is no automatic state management of live strategies in QuantConnect. We recommend algorithms reconstruct state or indicator needs using the <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/historical-data/warm-up-periods">WarmUp</a> and <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/historical-data/history-requests">History</a> methods.
</p>
<p>
    Once the algorithm has warmed up some objects you can use the <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/object-store">Object Store</a> to save the data for the next algorithm restart.
</p>

    In the event the algorithm is terminated unexpectedly, you should review the live algorithm portfolio at the brokerage to confirm it will behave as expected.
