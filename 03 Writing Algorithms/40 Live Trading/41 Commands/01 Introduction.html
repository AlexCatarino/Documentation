	Commands enable you to manually call methods in your live algorithm as it runs. 
	You can commands them to update your algorithm state, place orders, or run any other logic. 
	Commands are different from <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/live-trading/notifications'>notifications</a> because notifications enable you to send information out of your algorithm while commands enable you to send information into your algorithm.
