<p>
	Commands enable you to manually call methods in your live algorithm as it runs. 
	You can command live projects to update your algorithm state, place orders, or run any other logic. 
	Commands are different from <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/live-trading/notifications'>notifications</a> because 
	notifications enable you to send information <i>out</i> of your algorithm while commands enable you to send information <i>into</i> your algorithm.
