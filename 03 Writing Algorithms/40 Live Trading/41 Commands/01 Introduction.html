	Commands enable you to inject external data into your live algorithm as it runs. 
	You can use them to update your algorithm state, place orders, or run any other logic. 
	Commands are different from <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/live-trading/notifications'>notifications</a> because notifications enable you to send data out of your algorithm while commands enable you to send data into your algorithm.
