<p>Brokerages provide you with a connection to the market so you can fill trades. To avoid placing invalid orders for execution in live trading, LEAN validates your orders before sending them to the real brokerage. To view all of the integrated brokerages, see <a href="/docs/v2/cloud-platform/live-trading/brokerages">Brokerages</a>.</p>
