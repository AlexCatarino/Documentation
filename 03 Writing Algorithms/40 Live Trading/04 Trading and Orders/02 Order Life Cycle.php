<p>When you create an order ticket, LEAN validates it to avoid sending orders that will be rejected by your brokerage. If the order is invalid, it's status is set to <code>OrderStatus.Invalid</code>. Otherwise, LEAN sets the order status to <code>OrderStatus.New</code>, sends the order to your brokerage, and waits for the brokerage message. If your brokerage accepts the order, the order status becomes <code>OrderStatus.Submitted</code>. Otherwise, it becomes <code>OrderStatus.Canceled</code>.</p>

<p>You can update orders until they fill or the brokerage prevents modifications. If you place an order update request, LEAN validates it to avoid sending orders that will be rejected by you brokerage. If the order update is valid, LEAN sends the update request and waits for the brokerage message. If your brokerage accepts the update, the order status becomes <code>OrderStatus.UpdateSubmitted</code>. Otherwise, it becomes <code>OrderStatus.Canceled</code>.</p>

<p>The brokerage notifies LEAN when you order fills (<code class="csharp">OrderStatus.Filled</code><code class="python">OrderStatus.FILLED</code>), partially fills (<code>OrderStatus.PartiallyFilled</code>) or is canceled (<code>OrderStatus.Canceled</code>). The brokerage can cancel your order before it completely fills. For example, if you place a <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/trading-and-orders/order-types/market-on-open-orders">market on open</a> and the asset price moves before the market open to where you can't afford the quantity of the order, the brokerage rejects your order. The brokerage can also cancel your market on open order after partial fills if there is no shares left to trade.</p>
