<h4>Single Asset Targets</h4>
<p>
The SetHoldings method automatically calculates the number of asset units to purchase according to the fraction of the portfolio value provided. This is a quick way to set up a portfolio with a set of weights for assets. If you already have holdings you may want to liquidate the existing holdings first to free up buying power.
</p>
<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="csharp">// Allocate 50% of portfolio value to IBM via market orders
SetHoldings("IBM", 0.5);

// Allocate 50% of portfolio value to IBM, but liquidate other holdings before starting
SetHoldings("IBM", 0.5, true);
</pre>
<pre class="python"> # Allocate 50% of buying power to IBM via market orders.
self.SetHoldings("IBM", 0.5)

# Allocate 50% of portfolio value to IBM, but liquidate other holdings before starting
self.SetHoldings("IBM", 0.5, True)
</pre>
</div>

<h4>Portfolio of Asset Targets</h4>
<p>
Often when trading on a weighted basket of assets you must intelligently scale down existing positions, before increasing allocations to other assets. The portfolio variant of SetHoldings was designed to do this operation for you by accepting an array of $[PortfolioTarget, T:QuantConnect.Algorithm.Framework.Portfolio.PortfolioTarget] objects. </p>

<p>
If you already have holdings the LEAN engine will calculate the delta-order required to meet your new target. When required positions will be scaled down before other positions are scaled up in size.
</p>
<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="csharp">// Purchase a portfolio of targets, processing orders intelligently.
var targets = new List&lt;PortfolioTarget&gt;() {
      new PortfolioTarget("SPY", 0.8m),
      new PortfolioTarget("IBM", 0.2m)
};
SetHoldings(targets);
</pre>
<pre class="python"># Purchase a portfolio of targets, processing orders intelligently.
self.SetHoldings([PortfolioTarget("SPY", 0.8), PortfolioTarget("IBM", 0.2)])
</pre>
</div>

<h4>Manually Calculating Quantity Targets</h4>
<p>
If you are looking to size positions but not use <i>market orders</i> for the trades you can use the $[CalculateOrderQuantity, M:QuantConnect.Algorithm.QCAlgorithm.CalculateOrderQuantity] method to get an accurate estimate of the number of shares available to purchase with a given buying power fraction. The share quantity is calculated based on the current price of the asset and adjusted for the fee model attached to that security. 
</p>
<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="csharp">// Calculate the fee adjusted quantity of shares with given buying power
var quantity = CalculateOrderQuantity("IBM", 0.4);
LimitOrder("IBM", quantity, Securities["IBM"].Price);
</pre>
<pre class="python"> # Calculate the fee adjusted quantity of shares with given buying power
quantity = self.CalculateOrderQuantity("IBM", 0.4)
self.LimitOrder("IBM", quantity, self.Securities["IBM"].Price)
</pre>
</div>

<h4>Cash Buffer Setting</h4>
<p>
To ensure a high probability of order fills through market gaps and discontinuities the QuantConnect automatic portfolio methods assume a small built-in cash buffer. This buffer helps ensure you have sufficient buying power to handle overnight price movements. If you are seeing orders get rejected due to buying power you can configure this buffer to provide a wider buffer. By default, the buffer is set to 2.5%. The buffer lives on the algorithm $[Settings, T:QuantConnect.AlgorithmSettings] property.
</p>
<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="csharp">// Adjust the cash buffer from the default 2.5% to 5%
Settings.FreePortfolioValuePercentage = 0.05;
</pre>
<pre class="python"> # Adjust the cash buffer from the default 2.5% to 5%
self.Settings.FreePortfolioValuePercentage = 0.05
</pre>
</div>
