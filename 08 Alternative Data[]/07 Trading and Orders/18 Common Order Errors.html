<h4>Why is my order being converted to a market on open order?</h4>
<p>
Market orders are automatically converted into Market On Open orders when the market is closed at the time of the request. This most commonly happens when using Daily or Hourly data which is emitted when the market closes. Daily data is emitted at the end of the day (midnight), and hourly data for equities final bar is at 4pm ET. If you are using one of the automatic portfolio helper methods (<code>SetHoldings</code>) the orders will also be converted if the data resolution is insufficient. 
</p>
<p>To fix this we recommend using minute resolution data or updating your order creation logic to submit Market On Open orders.</p>

<h4>Why am I seeing the "stale price" warning?</h4>
<p>
If the last price data point was more than 10 minutes old LEAN will flag the orders with a warning tag indicating the price may not be representative. This can happen on illiquid assets or if you are scheduling intraday events using daily data.
</p>
<p>To fix this we recommend using the highest resolution data possible for a high fidelity backtest.</p>
