QuantConnect provides dozens of methods to create, update and cancel orders. These orders can be placed <a class="docs-internal-link" href="/docs/alternative-data/trading-and-orders#Trading-and-Orders-Automatic-Position-Sizing-SetHoldings">automatically</a> with helper methods, or manually through methods on the algorithm API. Manual orders can be <a class="docs-internal-link" href="/docs/alternative-data/trading-and-orders#Trading-and-Orders-Updating-Orders">fetched, updated and cancelled</a> with Order Tickets.  As orders are filled and updated they generate <a href="/docs/alternative-data/trading-and-orders#Trading-and-Orders-Tracking-Order-Events">events</a> which notify your algorithm about their execution.

<p>In backtesting order fills are simulated using historical data. QuantConnect allows you to create your own fill, fee, slippage and margin models via plugin points. You can control how optimisic or pesimistic these fills are with <a href="/docs/alternative-data/trading-and-orders#Trading-and-Orders-Slippage-and-Transaction-Models">transaction model</a> classes.  In live trading this fill price is set by your brokerage when the order is filled.</p>

In the following sections we will explore these concepts in more detail and explore specifics about each supported order type.
