<p>
QuantConnect endeavors to make our backtesting as realistic as possible by providing high resolution data, spread information, and powerful transaction models.  These models are customizable on a per security basis through setters on the API. 
</p>

<p>
As of November-2019 QuantConnect does not have quote data for US equities backtesting so trades are filled at the last trade price. 
We hope in the coming months to have this data installed for backtesting and live trading.

<h4>Order Slippage Impact</h4>
<p>
By default QuantConnect does not model slippage impact though we highly recommend you include a slippage model in your algorithm. Slippage is the difference between the expected and final fill prices of a trade. For more information on creating your own slippage models see our <a class="docs-internal-link" href="/docs/algorithm-reference/reality-modelling#Reality-Modelling-Slippage-Models">documentation</a>.
</p>

<h4>Transaction Cost Models</h4>
<p>By default transaction fees are modelled from Interactive Brokers Brokerage rates. These models are customizable by setting a new <code>FeeModel</code>. For more information on creating your own fee models see our <a class="docs-internal-link" href="/docs/algorithm-reference/reality-modelling#Reality-Modelling-Fee-Models">documentation</a>.</p>

<h4>Brokerage Models</h4>
<p>
Brokerage models aim to combine all of the models relevant for a brokerage together as a set. If you set the appropriate brokerage model the fee models and supported order types will be appropriately set in your algorithm. For more information on setting your brokerage models see our <a class="docs-internal-link" href="/docs/algorithm-reference/reality-modelling#Reality-Modelling-Brokerage-Models">documentation</a>.
