When a company repurchase their own stock (commonly known as buybacks) it reduces the number of shares available to other investors. QuantConnect hosts company buyback intentions and transaction data provided by <a href="https://www.smartinsider.com" target="_BLANK">Smart Insider</a>. Depending on the offer price this is seen as a positive event for shareholders.

    Smart Insider has two distinct data sets available to use in your algorithm. The <i>Intentions</i> dataset, is an announcement that establishes the intention to buyback shares of the company. 
When the buyback occurs this triggers a <i>Transaction</i> event with details about the execution of the buyback. <i>Intention</i> events come before the <i>Transaction</i> event.
