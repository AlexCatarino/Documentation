    QuantConnect hosts company buyback intentions and transactions data provided by Smart Insider. The data is rich with details surrounding buyback events and intentions.

<p>
    Smart Insider data has two distinct data sets that you can use in your algorithm. One of them is <i>Intentions</i>, which is an announcement that establishes the intention to buyback shares of the company. <i>Intentions</i> are events that come before the <i>Transaction</i> event, which is the buyback event itself and the details surrounding the execution of the buyback, To access intentions and transactions in your algorithm, you can use the following classes:
    <ul>
        <li>$[T,QuantConnect.Data.Custom.SmartInsider.SmartInsiderIntention]</li>
        <li>$[T,QuantConnect.Data.Custom.SmartInsider.SmartInsiderTransaction]</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    Because both of those classes derive from $[T,QuantConnect.Data.Custom.SmartInsider.SmartInsiderEvent], <i>Transactions</i> and <i>Intentions</i> both share the same set of fields. You can click on the red links above to view the available fields.
