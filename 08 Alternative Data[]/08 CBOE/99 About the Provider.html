<p>In 1993, Cboe Global Markets introduced the Cboe Volatility Index&reg; (VIX&reg; Index), which was originally designed to measure the market's expectation of 30-day volatility implied by at-the-money S&amp;P 100&reg; Index (OEX&reg; Index) option prices. The VIX Index soon became the premier benchmark for U.S. stock market volatility. It has been regularly featured in the Wall Street Journal, Barron's and other leading financial publications, as well as on business news shows, where the VIX Index is often referred to as the "Fear Index."</p>
