                The Treasury Department is the executive agency responsible for promoting economic prosperity and
                ensuring the financial security of the United States. The Department is responsible for a wide range of
                activities such as advising the President on economic and financial issues, encouraging sustainable
                economic growth, and fostering improved governance in financial institutions. The Department of the
                Treasury operates and maintains systems that are critical to the nation's financial infrastructure, such
                as the production of coin and currency, the disbursement of payments to the American public, revenue
                collection, and the borrowing of funds necessary to run the federal government.
