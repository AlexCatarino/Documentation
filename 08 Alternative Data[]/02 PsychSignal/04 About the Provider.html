<a href="https://psychsignal.com" target="_BLANK">PsychSignal</a> was founded in 2011. The initial objective was to create a sentiment engine that would make predictions about the mood of the general public. This objective was achieved in 2012 when the engine correctly predicted the Gallup US Mood Index one day in advance.
Over the following years, the company developed sophisticated natural language processing algorithms and social sentiment indices focused on the financial markets. PsychSignal has a diverse range of institutional clients that use its data to trade equities, ETFs and other publicly traded securities.
