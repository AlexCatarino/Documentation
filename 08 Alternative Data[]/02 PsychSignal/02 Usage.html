PsychSignal Sentiment is <em>linked</em> data source. This means news data is automatically tied to the underlying equity whenever possible. This linkage is performed by the ticker mentioned in the tweet article at the time it was published. To add the right sentiment feed to your strategy you should use the <em>equity</em> asset symbol.
