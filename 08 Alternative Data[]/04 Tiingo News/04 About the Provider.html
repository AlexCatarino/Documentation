<a href="https://api.tiingo.com" target="_BLANK">Tiingo News API</a> goes beyond traditional news sources as they focus on finding rich content written by knowledgeable writers for their audiences. They scan unstructured, non-traditional news and other information sources while using proprietary algorithms, to tag companies, topics, and assets. This refined system is backed by over ten years of research and development and is written by former institutional quant traders. Because of this dedicated approach, Tiingo's News API is a trusted tool used by quant funds, hedge funds, pension funds, social media companies, and tech companies.
