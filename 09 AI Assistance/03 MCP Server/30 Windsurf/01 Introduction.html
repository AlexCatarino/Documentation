  Cascade is an AI coding assistant in the Windsurf Editor that can connect various Large Language Models (LLM) to the <a href='/docs/v2/ai-assistance/mcp-server/key-concepts'>QuantConnect MCP Server</a>. 
  This page explains how to set up and use the server in Windsurf.

<div class='highlight'>Windsurf Cascade truncates long responses from the MCP Server, so it can be unstable for long backtests.</div>
