  There are no quotas on the QuantConnect API, but Windsurf Cascade and the LLMs have some. 
  To view the quotas, see <a href='https://docs.windsurf.com/plugins/accounts/usage#plans-and-credit-usage' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>Plans and Credit Usage</a> in the Windsurf documentation and see the quotas of the model you use.
