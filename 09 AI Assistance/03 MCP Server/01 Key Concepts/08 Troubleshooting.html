<p>The following sections explain some issues you may encounter and how to resolve them.</p>

<h4>No Tools Available</h4>
<p>
  When you open your MCP client, it can take up to 30 seconds for the MCP server to start up and for the client to connect to it. 
  Before you start entering prompts, check Docker Desktop to ensure the container is running and check the client to ensure it’s connected. 
</p>

<p>If the client can’t discover the tools after 30 seconds, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Shut down the client application.</li>
  
  <li>If the server doesn’t automatically shut down in Docker Desktop, click the <span class='icon-name'>trash</span> icon to shut it down.</li>

  <li>Restart the client application.</li>
</ol>

<p>Connection Error Code -32000</p>
<p>
  The <code>docker run ...</code> command in the configuration file also accepts a <code>--name</code> option, which sets the name of the Docker container when the MCP Server starts running. 
  If your computer tries to start up two MCP Server containers with the same name, this <span class='error-messages'>-32000</span> error occurs.
  To avoid the error, remove the <code>--name</code> option and its value from the configuration file.
  For an example of a working configuration file, see the <span class='page-section-name'>Getting Started</span> guide for one of the <a href='/docs/v2/ai-assistance/mcp-server'>supported MCP clients</a>.
</p>

<h4>Service Outages</h4>
<p>
  The MCP server relies on the QuantConnect API and the client application. 
  To check the status of the QuantConnect API, see our <a href='https://status.quantconnect.com/'>Status</a> page. 
  To check the status of your client and the LLM, see their status page.
