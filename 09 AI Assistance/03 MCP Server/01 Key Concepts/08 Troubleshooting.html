<p>The following sections explain some issues you may encounter and how to resolve them.</p>

<h4>No Tools Available</h4>
<p>
  When you open your MCP client, it can take up to 30 seconds for the MCP server to start up and for the client to connect to it. 
  Before you start entering prompts, check Docker Desktop to ensure the container is running and check the client to ensure it’s connected. 
</p>

<p>If the client can’t discover the tools after 30 seconds, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Shut down the client application.</li>
  
  <li>If the server doesn’t automatically shut down in Docker Desktop, click the <span class='icon-name'>trash</span> icon to shut it down.</li>

  <li>Restart the client application.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Service Outages</h4>
<p>
  The MCP server relies on the QuantConnect API and the client application. 
  To check the status of the QuantConnect API, see our <a href='https://status.quantconnect.com/'>Status</a> page. 
  To check the status of your client and the LLM, see their status page.
