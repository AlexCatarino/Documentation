  There are no quotas on the QuantConnect API, but the client you use may have quotas. 
  For more information about the quotas of each client, open <a href='/docs/v2/drafts/mcp-server'>MCP Server</a>, click one of the clients, then scroll down to the <span class='page-section-name'>Quotas</span> section.
