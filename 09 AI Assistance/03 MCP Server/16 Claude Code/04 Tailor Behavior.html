<p>
  The <span class='public-file-name'>CLAUDE.md</span> file is a special file that tailors how Claude behaves during your conversations.
  When you run <code>claude</code> to start a new conversation, Claude automatically pulls the <span class='public-file-name'>CLAUDE.md</span> file into context.
  To find the file, it checks your home directory (<span class='public-file-name'>~ / .claude /</span>) and it checks the current, parent, and child directories of where you run <code>claude</code>.
  The following <span class='public-file-name'>CLAUDE.md</span> file provides an example of how you might tailor Claude to aid in your QuantConnect workflow.
  Feel free to edit it to fit your needs.
  There is no strict format for the file.

## Purpose
This file defines the conventions and expectations for how Claude should interact with QuantConnect projects.

---

## Development Environment
- Code should be **Python-first**, but C# examples may be used for reference if necessary.
- The project Id is in the config file, under `cloud-id`. Don't call the `list_backtests` tool unless it's absolutely needed.
- External dependencies must be avoided unless they are supported in QuantConnect’s cloud environment. When in doubt, suggest native LEAN methods.
- When drafting code, prefer modular design. Place custom indicators in an `indicators/` directory.
- Prioritize classic QC algorithm design over the algorithm framework unless explicitly requested.
- When creating indicator objects (such as RSI, SMA, etc.), never overwrite the indicator method names (e.g., do not assign to `self.rsi`, `self.sma`, etc.). Instead, use a different variable name, preferably with a leading underscore for non-public instance variables (e.g., `self._rsi = self.rsi(self._symbol, 14)`). This prevents conflicts with the built-in indicator methods and ensures code reliability.
- After adding or editing code, call the compile tool (`create_compile` and `read_compile`) in the QuantConnect MCP server to get the syntax errors and then FIX ALL COMPILE WARNINGS.


---

## Data Handling
- Use QuantConnect’s **built-in dataset APIs** (Equity, Futures, Options, Crypto, FX).  
- For alternative datasets, reference [QuantConnect’s Data Library](https://www.quantconnect.com/datasets/) and link to documentation rather than suggesting unsupported APIs.

---

## Research Standards
- Backtest code should include:
  - A clear `initialize()` with securities, resolution, and cash set explicitly.
  - Example parameters (start date, end date, cash) that are realistic for production-scale testing.
  - At least one comment section explaining the strategy’s core logic.
- When generating new strategies, provide a **one-paragraph explanation** of the trading idea in plain English before showing code.
- Prefer **transparent, explainable strategies**. Avoid “black-box” style outputs.

---

## Style Guidelines
- Code must follow **PEP8** where possible.
- Use **docstrings** on all public classes and functions.
- Responses should be in **Markdown**, with code blocks fenced by triple backticks and the language identifier.

---

## Risk Management
- Always emphasize risk controls in strategy outputs:
  - Max position sizing rules.
  - Stop-loss or drawdown limits.
  - Portfolio exposure constraints.
- Always use the `live_mode` flag and log the live mode in `initialize`.

---

## Security & Compliance
- Do not reference or fabricate API keys, credentials, or client secrets.
- Avoid suggesting integrations with unsupported brokers.
- If a user requests something outside QuantConnect’s compliance boundaries (e.g., high-frequency order spoofing, or prohibited datasets), politely decline.

---

## Tone & Communication
- Keep responses professional, concise, and explanatory.
- Prioritize **clarity over cleverness**.  
- Always explain why you made a design choice if multiple options exist.
