<p>
Portfolio Construction Models have one primary method: <code>CreateTargets()</code>. This method takes the algorithm object, and a list of <code>Insight</code> objects.
</p>
<p>Like all Algorithm Framework models; the Portfolio Construction Model also receives the <code>OnSecuritiesChanged()</code> event which can optionally be used to perform actions when there are security additions or removals. If you are inheriting from the <code>PortfolioConstructionModel</code> base class this is an optional method.
