<p>The Algorithm Framework is now the recommended way to design strategies in QuantConnect. Following this well defined structure gives many advantages over conventional design:</p>
<h5 style="font-weight: bold;">Pluggable Algorithm Modules</h5>
<p>By using the algorithm framework your code will be able to instantly utilize all modules built within the framework. The modules clip together in well defined ways which enable them to be shared and swapped interchangeably. </p><h5 style="font-weight: bold;">Focus On Your Strengths</h5>
<p>By writing code in modules you can focus on your strengths. If you are great at building universes; you can build universe modules. If you have risk-management experience, you could write reusable risk monitoring technology.</p><h5 style="font-weight: bold;">Reduce Development By Using Community Modules</h5>
<p>Easily share modules you've made between algorithms or pull in ones produced by the community. The strict separation of duties makes the Algorithm Framework perfect for reusing code between strategies.</p>
