<p>The Algorithm Framework is built on top of the <code>QCAlgorithm</code> class; giving your strategy access to all the normal methods you use for algorithm development. The data output of each module flows into another predictably. </p><figure><img src="http://cdn.quantconnect.com/web/i/docs/algorithm-framework/architecture.png" class="img-responsive"><figcaption>

The trade signals (&nbsp;<i>Insights&nbsp;</i>) are converted into <i>Portfolio Targets</i> by the <i>Portfolio Construction</i> Module. The Portfolio Targets hold a target share quantity we'd like the algorithm to hold. To execute these targets efficiently the <i>Execution</i> module analyzes market conditions and fills the targets efficiently. Finally; the <i>Risk Management</i> Module monitors the market conditions and ensures our targets are still within safe risk parameters.</p>
