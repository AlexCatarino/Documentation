<p>The Algorithm Framework is built on top of the <code>QCAlgorithm</code> class; giving your strategy access to all the normal methods you use for algorithm development. Algorithms which implement the framework extend the <code>QCAlgorithmFramework</code> class. The framework data output of each module flows into another predictably. </p><figure><img src="http://cdn.quantconnect.com/web/i/docs/algorithm-framework/architecture.png" class="img-responsive"><figcaption>
QuantConnect Algorithm Framework Architecture.
</figcaption></figure><p><i>Assets</i> selected by the <i>Universe Selection </i>Module are fed into your <i>Alpha</i> Module to generate trade signals. The trade signals (&nbsp;<i>Insights&nbsp;</i>) are converted into <i>Portfolio Targets</i> by the <i>Portfolio Construction</i> Module. The Portfolio Targets hold a target share quantity we'd like the algorithm to hold. To execute these targets efficiently the <i>Execution</i> module fills the targets efficiently over time. Finally; the <i>Risk Management</i> Module ensures our targets are still within safe risk parameters and adjusts the portfolio targets if required.</p><p>For simply strategies this may seem like overkill; however even simple strategies can benefit from reusing the ecosystem of modules available in QuantConnect. Imagine pairing your EMA-cross with a better execution system? Or simply plugging in an open sourced trailing stop risk management module?</p>
