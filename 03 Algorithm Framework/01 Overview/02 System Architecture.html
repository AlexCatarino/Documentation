The Algorithm Framework is built into the $[QCAlgorithm,T:QuantConnect.Algorithm.QCAlgorithm] class; giving your strategy access to all the normal methods you use for algorithm development. You should be able to copy and paste your algorithms across without any changes. <b>No separate class is required.</b>

<p>The framework data output of each module flows into the next predictably. Assets selected by the <i>Universe Selection</i> Model are fed into your <i>Alpha</i> Model to generate trade signals. The trade signals (<i>Insights</i>) are converted into <i>Portfolio Targets</i> by the <i>Portfolio Construction</i> Model. The Portfolio Targets hold a target share quantity we'd like the algorithm to hold. To execute these targets efficiently the <i>Execution</i> module fills the targets efficiently over time. Finally; the <i>Risk Management</i> Model ensures our targets are still within safe risk parameters and adjusts the portfolio targets if required.

<p>For simple strategies this may seem like overkill to abstract out your algorithm concepts; however even simple strategies can benefit from reusing the ecosystem of modules available in QuantConnect. Imagine pairing your EMA-cross with a better execution system? Or simply plugging in an open-source trailing stop risk management model?</p>
