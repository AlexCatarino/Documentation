Manual Universe Selection chooses a static, fixed set of assets to trade. This is most useful when selecting a set of currencies, or a basket of ETF stocks. Currently manually selected universes cannot easily be updated after initialize but we will be adding methods to make this easier.</p>
<p>The <code>ManualUniverseSelectionModel</code> class is initialized with an array of <code>Symbol</code> objects at the UniverseSettings.Resolution data resolution. $[Symbol] objects can be created with the Symbol.Create method
