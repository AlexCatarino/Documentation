The Algorithm Framework performs real-time analysis into the effectiveness of your strategy; calculating various scores on your algorithm. These scores can be used to help you quickly identify areas of weakness to improve your models. There are three key scores calculated based on the <b>Alpha Model</b> insights: Direction Score, Magnitude Score and Estimated Alpha Value.
