The direction score is a measure of the <i>directional</i> accuracy of the predictions of your algorithm. When you create an Insight from an Alpha Module you create a prediction the market will move Up or Down. If your prediction is correct during your insight timeframe, you receive a positive score of [1]. If the asset moves in the wrong direction you will receive a [0] score.

<p>The scoring system only reviews the moment of the insight completion giving you a binary score of 1 or 0, depending on if you correctly predicted the direction. The sum of the insights for the backtest is averaged to give your overall direction score as a percentage.</p>
