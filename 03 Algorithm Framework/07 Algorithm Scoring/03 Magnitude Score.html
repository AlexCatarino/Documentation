<p>
An insight can optionally set the expected magnitude change of the asset over the insight period. This expected return can be used in the Portfolio Construction model to improve results.
</p>
<p>The magnitude score is calculated based on the distribution of the magnitude over the insight period. If your magnitude is correct at the end time, you will receive a high weighting. If you achieve the target magnitude in the time leading up to your endpoint, you'll receive a weighting towards your score but not as high.</p>
<p>If your insight immediately achieves the target magnitude and remains there for the duration of the period, you will receive a perfect score. </p>
