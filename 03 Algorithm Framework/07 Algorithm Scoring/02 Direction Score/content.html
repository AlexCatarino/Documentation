The direction score is a measure of the <i>directional</i> accuracy of the predictions of your algorithm. When you create an Insight from an Alpha Module you create a prediction the market will move Up or Down. If your prediction is correct during your insight timeframe, you receive a positive score between [0, 1]. If the asset moves in the wrong direction you will receive a 0-score.

<p>The scoring system assigns weight the more time your prediction is correct. If the price moves above the starting point immediately, for the whole period of the Insight you will receive a perfect score for the insight.</p>
