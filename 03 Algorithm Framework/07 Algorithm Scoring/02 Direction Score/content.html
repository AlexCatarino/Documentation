The direction score is a measure of the <i>directional</i> accuracy of the predictions of your algorithm. When you create an Insight from an Alpha Module you create an prediction the market will move Up or Down. If your prediction is correct at the end of your insight timeframe, you receive a positive score.

<p>Scoring an algorithm is a balance of an art and a science.Between the start of your Insight signal and the end of your timeframe there are infinite variations in the price movements. To solve this problem we've created a distribution scoring function which assigns weight based on the <i>time</i> the price was correctly predicted.
