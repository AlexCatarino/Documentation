Sometimes an algorithm's performance relies on multiple insights being traded together - such as pairs trading and an options straddle. These insights should be <i>grouped</i> together. Insight groups signals to the execution models that the insights need to be acted on as a single unit to maximize the alpha created.
</p>
<p>When you return the grouped insights from your Alpha Model; simply use the <code>Insight.Group()</code> helper method to mark the insights as a set.
</p>
<div class="section-example-container">
	<pre class="csharp"> // Insight helper for grouping insights together
return Insight.Group(insight1, insight2, insight3);</pre>
	<pre class="python"># Insight helper for grouping insights together
return Insight.Group( [ insight1, insight2, insight3 ] )
</pre>
</div>
