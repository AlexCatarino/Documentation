<div class="section-example-container">
	<pre class="csharp">class Insight {
    // Symbol of this Insight
    Symbol Symbol;
    
    // Gets the type of insight, for example, price insight or volatility insight
    InsightType Type;
    
    // Gets the predicted direction, Down, Flat or Up.
    InsightDirection Direction;

    // Gets the period over which this insight is expected to come to fruition
    TimeSpan Period;

    // Gets the predicted percent change in the insight type (price/volatility) (optional)
    double? Magnitude;

    // Gets the confidence in this insight (optional)
    double? Confidence { get; private set; }
}</pre>
