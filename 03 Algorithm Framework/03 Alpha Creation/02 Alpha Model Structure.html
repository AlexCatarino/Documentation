<p>
Alpha models are intended to be easy to create and the primary location for iterating your strategy. To create Alpha Models you must implement the $[IAlphaModel,T:QuantConnect.Algorithm.Framework.Alphas.IAlphaModel] interface as shown in the examples below. This has two methods:
</p>
<p>1. $[Update(),M:QuantConnect.Algorithm.Framework.Alphas.AlphaModel.Update] - Generate Insight objects.<br>2. $[OnSecuritiesChanged(),M:QuantConnect.Algorithm.Framework.Alphas.AlphaModel.OnSecuritiesChanged] - Receive notifications about security changes.
