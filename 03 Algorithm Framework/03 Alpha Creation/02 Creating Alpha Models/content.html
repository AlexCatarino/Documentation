<p>
To create Alpha Models you must implement the <code>IAlphaModel</code> interface. This has one method; <code>Update(QCAlgorithmFramework algorithm, Slice data)</code>. This gives you the algorithm object to call the base QuantConnect API in addition to data for the current moment of time.
</p>
<div class="section-example-container" >
	<pre class="all">// Algorithm framework model that produces insights 
interface IAlphaModel : INotifiedSecurityChanges
{ 
    // Updates this alpha model with the latest data from the algorithm.
    // This is called each time the algorithm receives data for subscribed securities
    Insight[] Update(QCAlgorithmFramework algorithm, Slice data)
}</pre>
</div>
<p>The Alpha Model returns an array of Insight objects. Insights hold the prediction for the asset. These can be thought of actionable trading signals; indicating the asset direction, magnitude and confidence in the near future. Insight classes have the following important properties:</p>
<div class="section-example-container" >
	<pre class="csharp">class Insight {
    // Symbol of this Insight
    Symbol Symbol;
    
    // Gets the type of insight, for example, price insight or volatility insight
    InsightType Type;
    
    // Gets the predicted direction, Down, Flat or Up.
    InsightDirection Direction;

    // Gets the period over which this insight is expected to come to fruition
    TimeSpan Period;

    // Gets the predicted percent change in the insight type (price/volatility) (optional)
    double? Magnitude;

    // Gets the confidence in this insight (optional)
    double? Confidence { get; private set; }
}</pre>
