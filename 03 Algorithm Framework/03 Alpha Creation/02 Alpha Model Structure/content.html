Alpha models are intended to be easy to create and the primary location for iterating your strategy. To create Alpha Models you must implement the <code>IAlphaModel</code> interface as shown in the examples below. This has two methods:
</p>
<p>1. <code>Update()</code> - Generate Insight objects.<br>2. <code>OnSecuritiesChanged()</code> - Receive notifications about security changes.
