<p>
To create Alpha Models you must implement the <code>IAlphaModel</code> interface. This has one method; <code>Update(QCAlgorithmFramework algorithm, Slice data)</code>. This gives you the algorithm object to call the base QuantConnect API in addition to data for the current moment of time. Alpha models are intended to be easy to create and the primary location for iterating your strategy.

<div class="section-example-container">
	<pre class="all">// Algorithm framework model that produces insights 
interface IAlphaModel : INotifiedSecurityChanges
{ 
    // Updates this alpha model with the latest data from the algorithm.
    // This is called each time the algorithm receives data for subscribed securities
    Insight[] Update(QCAlgorithmFramework algorithm, Slice data)
}</pre>

<p>The Alpha Model returns an array of Insight objects. An Insight is a <i>single</i> prediction for an asset. These can be thought of actionable trading signals; indicating the asset direction, magnitude and confidence in the near future. Insight classes have the following important properties:
