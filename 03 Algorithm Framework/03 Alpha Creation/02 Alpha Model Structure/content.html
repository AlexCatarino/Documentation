Alpha models are intended to be easy to create and the primary location for iterating your strategy. To create them you must implement the <code>IAlphaModel</code> interface as shown in the examples below. This has two methods:
</p>
<p>1. <code>Update()</code> - Generate Insight objects.<br>2. <code>OnSecuritiesChanged()</code> - Receive notifications about security changes.
</p>
<div class="section-example-container">
	<pre class="csharp">// Algorithm framework model that produces insights 
class MyAlphaModel : IAlphaModel, INotifiedSecurityChanges
{ 
    // Updates this alpha model with the latest data from the algorithm.
    // This is called each time the algorithm receives data for subscribed securities
    Insight[] Update(QCAlgorithmFramework algorithm, Slice data) {
         // Generate insights on the securities in universe.
    }

    void OnSecuritiesChanged(QCAlgorithmFramework algorithm, SecurityChanges changes) {
         // Handle security changes in from your universe model.
    }
}</pre>
	<pre class="python"># Algorithm framework model that produces insights 
class MyAlphaModel:

    def Update(self, algorithm, slice):
         # Updates this alpha model with the latest data from the algorithm.
         # This is called each time the algorithm receives data for subscribed securities
         # Generate insights on the securities in universe.
         insights = []
         return insights
    
    def OnSecuritiesChanged(self, algorithm, changes):
         # Handle security changes in from your universe model.</pre>
</div>
<p>The alpha model Update method returns an array of Insight objects. An Insight is a <i>single</i> prediction for an asset. These can be thought of actionable trading signals; indicating the asset direction, magnitude and confidence in the near future. Insight classes have the following important properties:
</p>
<div class="section-example-container">
	<pre class="csharp">class Insight {
    // Symbol of this Insight
    Symbol Symbol;
    
    // Gets the type of insight, for example, price insight or volatility insight
    InsightType Type;
    
    // Gets the predicted direction, Down, Flat or Up.
    InsightDirection Direction;

    // Gets the period over which this insight is expected to come to fruition
    TimeSpan Period;

    // Gets the predicted percent change in the insight type (price/volatility) (optional)
    double? Magnitude;

    // Gets the confidence in this insight (optional)
    double? Confidence { get; private set; }
}</pre>
	<pre class="python">class Insight:
    self.Symbol # Symbol of this Insight 
    self.Type # Type of insight (price or volatility)
    self.Direction # Insight Direction (down, flat or up)
