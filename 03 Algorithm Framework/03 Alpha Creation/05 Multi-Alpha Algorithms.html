The algorithm framework allows adding multiple alpha classes to your algorithm and generates Insights on all of them. The combined stream of Insights is then passed to the Portfolio Construction model. Nothing special is required to achieve this - simply use the <code>AddAlpha()</code> methods to add each one. Below is an example of combining two Alpha Models to be used in one algorithm:
</p>
<div class="section-example-container">
	<pre class="csharp">// Define alpha model as a composite of the rsi and ema cross models
AddAlpha( new RsiAlphaModel() );
AddAlpha( new EmaCrossAlphaModel() );</pre>
	<pre class="python"># Define alpha model as a composite of the rsi and ema cross models
self.AddAlpha( RsiAlphaModel() )
self.AddAlpha( EmaCrossAlphaModel() )</pre>
</div>
<p>As many Alpha Models as required can be added to the algorithm. Each Alpha Model has a unique name, and the Insights generated are automatically named according to the source Alpha Model which created it.</p>
