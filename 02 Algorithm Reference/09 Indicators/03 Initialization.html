	As indicators may need data from a lookback period to yield values that are ready to use, we need to warm up the indicator with historical data. There are two methods.
</p>
<h4>Set the warm-up period</h4>
<p>
	The first method is to set the warm-up period and let the engine automatically update the indicators with data prior to the start date of the algorithm.
	In Initialize(), you can specify a warm-up period with the number of bars <code>SetWarmUp(int barCount)</code>.
	<code>barCount</code> is based on the resolution when you subscribe the asset data.
	If the indicator resolution is different from the data subscription resolution when adding the asset,
	you can use the time period <code>SetWarmUp(TimeSpan period)</code> or <code>SetWarmup(TimeSpan timeSpan, Resolution resolution)</code>.
	To make sure the data in the warm-up period covers the indicator period, this timespan should be longer than the period in indicator setting because only the trading days has the data.
	See more about the indicator warm-up in the <a class="docs-internal-link" href="/docs/algorithm-reference/historical-data">History</a> section.
	This method can not be used to warm up the indicator in universe selection algorithm.
</p>

<h4>Warm-Up with History Request</h4>
<p>
	The second method is to request the history data to update the indicator in initialization manually.
