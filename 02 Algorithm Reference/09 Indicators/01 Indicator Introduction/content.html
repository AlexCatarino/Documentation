<p>We provide more than 100 technical indicators for you to use in your algorithm. These are provided in two ways; through helper short cut methods, and as class objects. Indicators created through the short cut methods have already been wired up to receive data and are "ready to use". A full list of the indicators and their properties can be found in the reference table below.</p>
<p>One key indicator to learn is the  <a href='https://www.quantconnect.com/lean/docs#topic217.html' target='_BLANK' class='lean-documentation' title='Open Identity API Documentation'>Identity </a>  indicator which simply returns the value of the asset. This can be useful for combining indicators together. For example:

<pre>var pep = Identity("PEP");    // Pepsi ticker
var coke = Identity("KO");    // Coke ticker
var delta = pep.Minus(coke);  // Difference between them
</pre></p>
