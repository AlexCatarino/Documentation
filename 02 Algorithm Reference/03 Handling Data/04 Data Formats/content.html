<p>There are six financial data types: TradeBars, Ticks, Delistings, SymbolChangedEvents, Splits and Dividends.</p>
<p>All data extends from $[BaseData] - the core data class which provides Symbol, Time and Value properties.</p>
<p>$[TradeBar] events contains Open, High, Low, Close and Volume properties for a given period of time.</p>
<p>$[Dividend C] events are triggered on payment of a dividend. It provides the Distribution per share.</p>
<p>$[Split] events are triggered on a share split or reverse split event. It provides a SplitFactor and ReferencePrice.</p>
<p>$[SymbolChangedEvent]  provide notice of new ticker names for stocks, or mergers of two tickers into one. It provides the OldSymbol and NewSymbol tickers.</p>
<p>$[Delisting] events provide notice an asset is no longer trading on the exchange.</p>
<p>$[Ticks C] is a string indexed dictionary of lists of ticks.</p>
<p>These data types all have dedicated event handlers which follow the pattern above (<code>public void OnData(Type data) {}</code>); and are also passed into the OnData(Slice data) event handler.</p>
