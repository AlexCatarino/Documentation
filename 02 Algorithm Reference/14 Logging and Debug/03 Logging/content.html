	Algorithms can save more detailed messaging to log files for later analysis using <code>Log(string message)</code>. At the end of the backtest a link will be presented to view your results.

	Because of vendor limitations free users are capped to 10kb of logs per backtest, with a maximum of 3Mb per day. Users with a subscription can generate up to 100kb of logs per backtest.
