Intrino is a third party aggregator platform like Quandl which is able to serve paid datasets. They provide a large library of financial datasets which might be useful for your algorithm. To assist using Intrino data in your algorithm we've created an <code>IntrinioEconomicData</code> implementation which grants access to their repository of economic data from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED).

<p>We've built helpers of the most requested symbols on the <a href="https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean/blob/master/Common/Data/Custom/Intrinio/EconomicDataSources.cs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>IntrinioEconomicDataSources</code></a> class; but if you like you can get the full list of economic data series is available <a href="http://docs.intrinio.com/master/economic-indices#home" target="_blank">here</a>.
