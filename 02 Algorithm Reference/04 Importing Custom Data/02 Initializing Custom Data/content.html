	During initialize your algorithm must use <code>AddData&lt;T&gt;(string ticker, Resolution resolution = Resolution.Daily)</code>. This gives LEAN the T-type factory to create the objects, the name of the data and the resolution at which to poll the data to check for updates.

<p>
	The framework checks for new data every as instructed by the <code>Resolution</code> period, i.e. Resolution.Tick polls constantly, Resolution.Second polls every second, and Resolution.Minute every minute. Hourly and Daily Resolutions are polled every 30 minutes to prevent skipping a day if the data was emitted late.
