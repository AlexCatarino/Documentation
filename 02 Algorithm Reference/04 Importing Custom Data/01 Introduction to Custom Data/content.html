<p>LEAN supports backtesting almost any external custom data source. To use this feature you need to add the data during initialize using <code>AddData&lt;T&gt;()</code> and instruct your algorithm how to read your data. We provide helpers for popular data sources like Quandl, but if you are using your own format / server you'll need to create a custom type.</p>
