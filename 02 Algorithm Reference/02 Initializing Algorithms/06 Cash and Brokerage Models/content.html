<meta name="tag" content="brokerage models">
<p>
	In QuantConnect by default we model your algorithm with margin-modeling but you can select a cash account type. 
	Cash accounts do not allow leveraged trading, whereas Margin accounts support 2-4x leverage on your account value. You can set
	your brokerage account type in your initialization with <code>SetBrokerageModel(BrokerageName brokerage, AccountType account);</code>.
</p>
<p>
	The <code>BrokerageName</code> enum supports values of Default, InteractiveBrokersBrokerage, FxcmBrokerage and 
	OandaBrokerage, GDAX.  When setting the brokerage name we also set the trading fee structures for that brokerage.
</p>
<p>
	The <code>AccountType</code> enum supports values of Cash and Margin. When using cash leverage is disabled by default, and the 
	cash settlement period is set to 3 days. Margin accounts are settled immediately and have a leverage of 2.
</p>
<p>
	Margin accounts with more than $25,000 in equity are eligible for pattern day trading margin limits. This increases your available
	leverage to 4x while the market is open and 2x overnight. To model this behavior in your algorithm you must set your security 
	<code>MarginModel</code> to <code>PatternDayTradingMarginModel</code>.
