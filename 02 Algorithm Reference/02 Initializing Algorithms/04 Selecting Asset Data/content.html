	Algorithms can manually subscribe to data for specific assets they need, or use universes to choose groups of assets based on 
	filtering criteria (e.g. all stocks with volumes greater than $10M/day). See more about Universes <a href="#Universes">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
	To manually subscribe to a specific asset you can call the <code>AddEquity()</code>, <code>AddForex()</code>, <code>AddCrypto()</code>,
	<code>AddCfd()</code> and <code>AddOption()</code> methods in your Initialize() method. There is no official limit to how much data
	you can ask for; but there are practical resource limitations. 
</p>
<p>
	QuantConnect supports international trading across multiple timezones and markets. The <code>Market</code> parameter is used
	to distinguish between the same tickers on different exchanges (e.g. FXCM and OANDA both offer EURUSD, but have different
	rates).
</p>
<p>
	QuantConnect provides 40TB of data. Check out more information about our data in our <a href="/data">data library</a>.
	The resolution of the data available depends on the type of data. For Equities, Futures, Forex and Crypto we provide Tick, 
	Second, Minute, Hourly and Daily resolution. For Options we only have minute bar data. These are specified by the 
	<code>Resolution</code> enum.
</p>
<p>
	If there is a gap in the data (e.g. because there are no trades), by default the data is still pumped into your strategy on
	each time step. This behavior is called "fillForward" and defaults to true. You can disable this by setting fillForward to false.
</p>
<p>
	By default equity data in QuantConnect is Split and Dividend adjusted backwards in time to give smooth continuous prices.
	This allows easy  use for indicators. Some algorithms need raw or partially adjusted price data. You can control this with 
	the <code>SetDataNormalizationMode()</code> method. The <code>DataNormalizationMode</code> enum has the values Adjusted (default),
	Raw, SplitAdjusted, and TotalReturn. When data is set to Raw mode the dividends are paid as cash into your algorithm and the 
	splits are directly applied to your holding quantity.
</p>
