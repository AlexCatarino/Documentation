A common request is to compare a current consolidated bar with one from the past. This can be achieved by combining a <a class="docs-internal-link" href="/docs/algorithm-reference/rolling-window">RollingWindow</a> with a Consolidator. This is easy to achieve with the individual tools provided here and in the RollingWindow documentation. First, you must create a consolidator for the data you need, and then you must add it to the rolling window in the event handler. Building this will allow you to easily compare recent custom-bars with previous ones created.

<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="csharp">
// In initialize create a consolidator and add its bars to the window
_window = new RollingWindow&lt;TradeBar&gt;(2);
Consolidate("SPY", TimeSpan.FromMinutes(45), x => _window.Add(x));

// Now you can use the bar history; _window[0] is current, _window[1] is previous bar.
if (_window.IsReady && _window[0].Close &gt; _window[1].Close) { 
     Log("Current close price higher than the one 45 minutes ago");
}
</pre>
<pre class="python">
# In initialize create a consolidator and add its bars to the window
self.window = RollingWindow[TradeBar](2)
self.Consolidate("SPY", timedelta(minutes=45), lambda x: self.window.Add(x))

# Now you can use the bar history; window[0] is current, window[1] is previous bar.
if self.window.IsReady and window[0].Close > window[1].Close:
     self.Log("Current close price higher than the one 45 minutes ago")
