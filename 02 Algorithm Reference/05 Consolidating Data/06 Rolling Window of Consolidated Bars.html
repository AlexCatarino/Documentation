A common request is to create a rolling window of custom sized bars. This is easy to achieve with the individual tools provided here and in the RollingWindow documentation. First, you must create a consolidator for the data you need, and then you must add it to the rolling window in the event handler. Building this will allow you to easily compare recent custom-bars with previous ones created.
