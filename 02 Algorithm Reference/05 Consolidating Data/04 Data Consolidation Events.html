<p>
The result of the aggregated bars is passed into an <i>event handler</i>. An event handler is a function in your algorithm designed to receive the bar. It can have any name but must have the required parameters. There are two event handler argument patterns:

<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="csharp">
// self.Consolidate() Event Handler
void FortyFiveMinuteBarHandler(TradeBar consolidated) {
}

// Manually Created Event Handler
void ThirtyMinuteBarHandler(object sender, TradeBar consolidated) {
}
</pre>
<pre class="python">
# self.Consolidate() Event Handler
def FortyFiveMinuteBarHandler(self, consolidated):
      pass

# Manually Created Event Handler
def ThirtyMinuteBarHandler(self, sender, consolidated):
      pass
</pre>
</div>

<h4>Most Common Error: Adding Braces<h5>
<p>
The most common error is to put braces "<code>()</code>" at the end of your function call when defining the event handler. Using braces causes the method to be executed, and the <i>result</i> passed in as the event handler. Remember to simply pass the name of your function to the event system. i.e. It should be <code class="python">self.EventHandler</code> not <code class="python">self.EventHandler()</code>.
