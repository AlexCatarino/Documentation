<p><p>If you'd like to have an indicator updated using a specific resolution of data; e.g. 30-period, 15-minute EMA; then you should ideally use the helper methods which come with the indicators. Most indicators handle setting up these resolution periods for you. See <a href="#Indicators">Indicators</a> for more information.</p>

<p>You may have a custom indicator which doesn't have this helper. In this case you should register your indicator with the  <a href='https://www.quantconnect.com/lean/docs#topic312.html' target='_BLANK' class='lean-documentation' title='Open RegisterIndicator API Documentation'>RegisterIndicator </a>  function which will automatically create a consolidator and pipe the data into your Indicator class.</p>

<p>In very rare cases you may want to update your indicator manually. You can do this by passing each data point into your <code>indicator.Update()</code> method from your consolidator <code>DataConsolidated</code> event handler.</p></p>
