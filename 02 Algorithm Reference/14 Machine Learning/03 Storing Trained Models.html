<p>
Once models are trained you are able to store the results into an <i>object store</i>. This is a permanent project specific storage location for data located in QuantConnect. Objects are accessible from backtesting and live, and are stored with a key. You can think of this almost like a private project DropBox for your model data. 
</p>
<p>The object store can be used as a back up of your algorithm variables, or to load a complex AI model which you don't wish to re-train. Once stored your data is backed up on QuantConnect servers until requested.</p>
<p>
When deploying a live algoithm, your state is loaded from the object store on deployment. Currently, it is not "refreshed" so you will need to redeploy the live algorithm when you wish to reload your data.

<h4>Storing Data</h4>
<p>
The Object Store is accessible in the root of your algorithm. It has the following methods available for storing data. You can see an example of using these in the <a class="csharp" target="_BLANK" href="https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean/blob/master/Algorithm.CSharp/ObjectStoreExampleAlgorithm.cs">demonstration algorithm</a><a class="python" target="_BLANK" href="https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean/blob/master/Algorithm.Python/ObjectStoreExampleAlgorithm.py">demonstration algorithm</a>.

<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="python">
self.ObjectStore.Save("key", "value")            # Save data as a string
self.ObjectStore.SaveBytes("key", "value")       # Save data as a bytes
self.ObjectStore.SaveJson("key", objectValue)    # Save object as JSON encoded string
self.ObjectStore.SaveXml("key", objectValue)     # Save object as XML encoded string
</pre>
</div>

<h4>Reading Data</h4>
<p>

</p>
<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="python">
val = self.ObjectStore.Read("key")            # Read data as string
bytes = self.ObjectStore.ReadBytes("key")     # Read data as bytes
jsonObj = self.ObjectStore.ReadJson("key")    # Deserialize a JSON object from storage
xmlObj = self.ObjectStore.ReadXml("key")      # Deserialize a XML object from storage
</pre>
</div>

<h4>Deleting Data</h4>
<p>
You can delete data from the object store using the <code>Delete()</code> method.
</p>
<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="python">
self.ObjectStore.Delete("key")            # Delete the data from the store
</pre>
</div>
