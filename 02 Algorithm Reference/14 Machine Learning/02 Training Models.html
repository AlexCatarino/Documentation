<p>
The <code>Train</code> feature allows you to get an increase in computation time to perform your model training for your machine learning strategies. Normally algorithms must perform all necessary work within 10-minutes before returning from the OnData method. With the training features, these limits have been increased to 2-hours to give you time to run your models.
</p>

<h4>Initializing a Model</h4>
<p>
Models can be trained immediately with the <code>Train()</code> method. This is most useful for training the model immediately on deployment of your strategy to production or when its performance begins to degrade.
</p>
<div class="section-example-container" >
<pre class="csharp">// Trigger a training immediately in your training method.
Train(MyTrainingMethod);</pre>
<pre class="python"># Trigger a training immediately in your training method.
self.Train(self.MyMethod)</pre> 
</div>

<h4>Scheduling Training</h4>
<p>
Model training can be scheduled in a very similar way to a scheduled event. To do this you need to pass in a <code>DateRule</code> and <code>TimeRule</code> argument to the <code>Train</code> method. You can see a full list of available date and time rules in the <a href="/docs" class="docs-internal-link">scheduled event</a> documentation.
</p>

<h4>Training Limits</h4>
<p>Training resources are allocated with a <a target="_BLANK" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaky_bucket">leaky bucket algorithm</a> where a maximum of n-hours can be used in a single training, and the allocated time refills slowly over time. This model gives you burst allocations when needed and recharges the allowance to prepare for the next training. Limits are configured by server-type according to the table below.
