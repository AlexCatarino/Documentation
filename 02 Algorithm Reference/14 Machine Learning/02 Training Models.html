<p>
The <code>Train</code> feature allows you to get an increase in computation time to perform your model training for your machine learning strategies. Normally algorithms must perform all necessary work within 10-minutes before returning from the OnData method. With the training features, these limits have been increased to 2-hours to give you time to run your models.
</p>

<h4>Initializing a Model</h4>
<p>
Models can be trained immediately with the <code>Train()</code> method. When called with a method argument the method can then be run for a longer period without the algorithm terminating the process.
</p>

<h4>Scheduling Training</h4>
<p>
Model training can be scheduled in a very similar way to a scheduled event. To do this you need to pass in a <code>DateRule</code> and <code>TimeRule</code> argument to the <code>Train</code> method. You can see a full list of available date and time rules in the <a href="/docs" class="docs-internal-link">scheduled event</a> documentation.
</p>

<h4>Training Limits</h4>
<p>Training resources are allocated with a <a target="_BLANK" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaky_bucket">leaky bucket algorithm</a> where a maximum of n-hours can be used in a single training, and the allocated time refills slowly over time. This model gives you burst allocations when needed and recharges the allowance to prepare for the next training.
