<h4>Using Semaphore to Synchronize Model Usage and Training</h4>
<p>
A "semaphore" is a thread-safe flag you can use to synchronize program operation across different threads. Because your model trainings can take a long time they are processed in a separate thread from your algorithm data. You need to confirm the model is ready to use before using it to generate predictions.

        # Once training is complete; use the model safely.
