<p>We provide a powerful charting API which can be build many chart types. At its simplest it can be used with a single line of code:
<pre class="csharp">Plot("Series Name", value);</pre>
<pre class="python">Plot("Series Name", value)</pre></p>
<p>With this code a line-graph is added underneath your <i>Strategy Equity</i> chart and your requested values are displayed over time. To create a new chart (new tab) you should also specify the chart name in your request:
<pre class="csharp">Plot("My Indicators", "EMA", ema);</pre></p>
<p>Behind the scenes these methods create a new  <a href='https://www.quantconnect.com/lean/docs#topic6940.html' target='_BLANK' class='lean-documentation' title='Open Chart API Documentation'>Chart </a>  object and add it to your algorithm, and then add a new  <a href='https://www.quantconnect.com/lean/docs#topic6953.html' target='_BLANK' class='lean-documentation' title='Open Series API Documentation'>Series </a>  object to that chart. A chart is made from many series. You can also initialize your charts manually to get more control over their look and feel.</p>
