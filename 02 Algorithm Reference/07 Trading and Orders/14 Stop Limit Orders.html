Stop Limit Orders create a limit order when a specified price is reached. The associated limit order is filled when it reaches the limit price or better. As with all limit orders, the order is not filled if the price does not reach the specified price.  Stop limit orders are often used to control risk, without the risk of a large gap filling trades unfavorably.
