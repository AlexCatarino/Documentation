A Stop Market Order ("stop-loss") fills as a market order when a specific price is reached. A buy stop market order to purchase assets will trigger when the price is equal or lower than the one configured. Conversely, a sell stop market order will trigger when the price is equal or higher to the one set. Stop market orders are often used to prevent loss.

<p>If the market gaps (jumps in a discontinuous manner) past your stop price it may be filled at a substantially worse price than the stop price you entered. As such a stop-loss order is no guarantee your trade will fill at the price you specify.</p>
