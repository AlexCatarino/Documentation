<p>
Market Orders are sent immediately and filled at the market price for the security. To send a market order, you must provide a symbol and quantity. If you do not have sufficient capital for the purchase, your order will be rejected. By default, market orders are <i>synchronous</i> and fill immediately.
</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="csharp">// Create a Market Order for 100 shares of IBM.
var marketTicket = MarketOrder("IBM", 100);
Debug($"Market Order Fill Price: {marketTicket.AverageFillPrice});
</pre>
<pre class="python"> # Create a Market Order for 100 shares of IBM.
marketTicket = self.MarketOrder("IBM", 100)
self.Debug("Market Order Fill Price: {0}".format(marketTicket.AverageFillPrice))
</pre>
</div>

<h4>Configuring Market Order Timeouts</h4>
<p>
Market orders are synchronous by default. This means they wait for the order to fill before moving to the next line of code. If you are trading on highly illiquid stocks, this wait can be too long, so LEAN has a built-in default timeout of 5 seconds, after which the code execution will continue even if the trade is not filled. You can control this timeout with the <code>Transactions.MarketOrderFillTimeout</code> property.
</p>
<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="csharp">// Adjust the market fill-timeout to 30 seconds.
Transactions.MarketOrderFillTimeout = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(30);
</pre>
<pre class="python"> # Adjust the market fill-timeout to 30 seconds.
self.Transactions.MarketOrderFillTimeout = timedelta(seconds=30)
</pre>
</div>

<h4>Asynchronously Sending Market Orders</h4>
<p>
When trading on a large portfolio of assets, you may wish to send orders in batches and not wait for the response to each one. This is possible by setting the optional argument <code>asynchronous</code> to true.
</p>
<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="csharp">// Create a Market Order for 100 shares of IBM asynchronously.
MarketOrder("IBM", 100, asynchronous: true);
</pre>
<pre class="python"> # Create a Market Order for 100 shares of IBM asynchronously. 
self.MarketOrder("IBM", 100, True)
</pre>
</div>
