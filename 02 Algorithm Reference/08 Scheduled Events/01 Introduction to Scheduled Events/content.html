<p>Scheduled events allow you to trigger code to run at specific times of day. This happens regardless of your data events. The schedule API requires a date and time rule to specify when the event is fired.</p>
<p>Scheduled events need a  <a href='https://www.quantconnect.com/lean/docs#topic25183.html' target='_BLANK' class='lean-documentation' title='Open DateRules API Documentation'>DateRules </a>  and  <a href='https://www.quantconnect.com/lean/docs#topic451.html' target='_BLANK' class='lean-documentation' title='Open TimeRules API Documentation'>TimeRules </a>  pair to set a specific time. When the event is triggered the action block is executed.</p>
