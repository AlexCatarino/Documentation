In order to live trade with GDAX, QuantConnect users must sign up for a GDAX account here: https://gdax.com. After obtaining an account, the next step is to create a GDAX api token. Sign into your GDAX account and click 'API' from the menu in the upper right.  On the API page, users should select the 'View' and 'Trade' permissions. Click 'Create API key' on the bottom of the page. Be sure to record the api key, api passphrase and api secret. </p><p>  Return to QuantConnect.com and go to the algorithm that you want to trade live.

GDAX only support cash trading so you cannot place trades when you do not have the cash in your account. 'Cash' in this sense means any of the crypto coin types. </p><div class="section-example-container"><pre>SetBrokerageModel(BrokerageName.GDAX, AccountType.Cash)</pre></div><p>For example, if you have $100,000 USD; but no LTC in your portfolio - you cannot trade BTCLTC, and in order to trade BTCEUR you need EUR in your portfolio. This means you must make trading decisions based on the <code>Cashbook</code>. This holds your current balance of coins available.</p>
