<h5 style="font-weight: bold;">Selecting Data</h5>
<p>
To subscribe to cryptocurrency data add crypto assets like below:
</p>
<div class="section-example-container">
	<pre>AddCrypto(string pair, Resolution resolution = Resolution.Minute)</pre>
</div>
<p>GDAX trades are currently available from 2015-06-15 to the present. The data in 2015 is somewhat spotty and unrealistic so we recommend starting your backtests from 2016 onwards. We have data on all currency pairs supported by GDAX.</p>
<p>The default market for crypto is assumed to be GDAX. To change the market, specify the market name in the <code>AddCrypto</code> command. For example, to subscribe to hourly resolution, BTCUSD, Bitfinex data in your algorithm, use the following method:
</p>
<div class="section-example-container">
	<pre>AddCrypto("BTCUSD", Resolution.Hour, Market.Bitfinex)</pre>
</div>
<p>Note this is provided as an example only. We currently only have GDAX brokerage integration.</p>
<h5 style="font-weight: bold;">Using Data</h5>
<p> Crypto-currency assets have TradeBar data. This can be accessed in the Slice or TradeBars object in OnData event handler:</p>
<div class="section-example-container">
	<pre class="csharp">var bar = data.Bars["BTCUSD"];</pre>
	<pre class="python">bar = data["BTCUSD"]</pre>
</div>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<div class="section-example-container">
	<pre>var coinPair = Securities["BTCUSD"];</pre>
	<pre><span style="font-family: Menlo, Monaco, Consolas, &quot;Courier New&quot;, monospace; font-size: 13px;">coinPair</span> = self.Securities["BTCUSD"]
</pre>
</div>
<h5 style="font-weight: bold;">Live Trading</h5>
<p>Crypto currency live trading is available through the GDAX brokerage. In order to live trade with GDAX, QuantConnect users must sign up for a GDAX account here: https://gdax.com. After obtaining an account, the next step is to create a GDAX API token. Sign into your GDAX account and click 'API' from the menu in the upper right.  On the API page, users should select the 'View' and 'Trade' permissions. Click 'Create API key' on the bottom of the page. Be sure to record the API key, API passphrase and API secret. </p>
<p>  Return to QuantConnect.com and go to the algorithm that you want to trade live. Select, 'Go Live' from the upper right hand corner. Follow the 'Live' wizard and select 'GDAX' as your brokerage. Be sure to copy your API values and passcode correctly in the wizard.</p>
<p>One common stumbling block that users face deploying their algorithms live with GDAX is a misunderstanding of Cash modeling. GDAX only supports cash trading so you cannot place trades when you do not have the cash in your account. 'Cash' in this sense means any of the crypto coin types. </p>
<div class="section-example-container">
	<pre class="csharp">SetBrokerageModel(BrokerageName.GDAX, AccountType.Cash)</pre>
	<pre class="python">self.SetBrokerageModel(BrokerageName.GDAX, AccountType.Cash)</pre>
</div>
<p>For example, if you have $100,000 USD; but no LTC in your portfolio - you cannot trade BTCLTC, and in order to trade BTCEUR you need EUR in your portfolio. This means you must make trading decisions based on the <code>Cashbook</code>. This holds your current balance of coins available.
