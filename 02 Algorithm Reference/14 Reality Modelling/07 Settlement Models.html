	After a trade is made brokerages settle the cash depending on the markets and account type. This is managed by our Settlement Models. The most common settlement type is immediate - where the funds are available for trading immediately. This is handled by the $[ImmediateSettlementModel,T:QuantConnect.Securities.ImmediateSettlementModel]. US Equities trading with cash accounts is typically settled 3 days after the transaction occurred. This is managed by the $[DelayedSettlementModel,T:QuantConnect.Securities.DelayedSettlementModel].
</p>
<p>
	Settlement models implement the $[ISettlementModel,T:QuantConnect.Securities.ISettlementModel] interface. You can create your own settlement model by implementing this method. Most users will not need to create their own settlement model and can use one of the ones provided above.
