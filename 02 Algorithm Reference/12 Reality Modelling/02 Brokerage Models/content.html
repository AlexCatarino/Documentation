	We provide a shortcut to set common models and properties relating to each of the brokerages we support. 
	These brokerage models set fees, fill models, slippage models and trading markets for a brokerage. In addition they 
	validate it is possible to submit trades to the brokerage (e.g. submitting equity trades to a forex only brokerage).

	<ul>
		<li>Transaction fees models</li>
		<li>Supported markets</li>
		<li>Slippage model</li>
		<li>Validate orders and updates before they are submitted</li>
		<li>Default account type (margin or cash account)</li>
		<li>Support for extended market hours</li>
		<li>How splits and dividends are applied to open order tickets</li>
		<li>Default leverage for assets</li>
		<li>Default settlement models</li>
	</ul>

	This gives you enormous control over your algorithm behavior and allow you to model virtually any brokerage in the world.

<p>
	In addition to our default brokerage model ($[DefaultBrokerageModel]), we provide brokerage models for
	Interactive Brokers ($[InteractiveBrokersBrokerageModel]), FXCM ($[FxcmBrokerageModel]) and OANDA ($[OandaBrokerageModel]).
</p>
<p>
	Brokerage models override any other models you may set for a security.
