<p>Universe Selection sends a large data set into a filter function. After passing through your filters the algorithm needs you to return an array of <code>Symbol</code> objects. LEAN automatically subscribes to these new symbols and adds them to your algorithm.</p>

<p>Your algorithm can do almost anything inside your filter functions, but the goal should be to narrow down the 8,000 daily stocks to a few which are most applicable for your algorithm.</p>
<p>The first stage of the filter is called "Coarse Universe Selection". This is for roughly filtering down the universe by simple properties like price and volume. The <i>result</i> of this is piped into the Fine Universe Selection function to perform selection on fundamental data like PE Ratio, and Earnings.</p>

<p>By default assets selected by universe selection are requested with minute resolution data. You can change the default selection by adjusting the <code>UniverseSettings</code> property which we'll dive into below.</p>
