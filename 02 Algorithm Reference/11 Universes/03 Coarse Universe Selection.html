<p>
Coarse Universe selection allows you to pick a set of stocks by its volume, price or whether it has fundamental data. This is helpful to narrow down your universe to liquid assets, or assets which pass a technical indicator filter.
</p>

<p>
To use a coarse universe you must request it using an $[AddUniverse(), M:QuantConnect.Algorithm.QCAlgorithm.AddUniverse] call from the Initialize() method of your algorithm. You should pass in a function which will be used to filter the stocks down to the assets you are interested in using.

<div class="section-example-container" >
<pre class="csharp">
public class MyCoarseUniverseAlgorithm : QCAlgorithm {
    public override void Initialize() {
        AddUniverse(MyFilterFunction);
    }
    // Coarse Filter Function accepts a list of CoarseFundamental Objects. 
    IEnumerable&lt;Symbol&gt; MyFilterFunction(IEnumerable&lt;CoarseFundamental&gt; coarse) {
         
    }
}
</pre>
<pre class="python">
class MyCoarseUniverseAlgorithm(QCAlgorithm):
     def Initialize(self):
         self.AddUniverse(self.MyFilterFunction)

    def MyFilterFunction(self, coarse):
         pass
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The coarse filter function is provided a list of $[CoarseFundamental,T:QuantConnect.Data.UniverseSelection.CoarseFundamental] objects. The most important properties of this object are: <code>Price</code>, <code>DollarVolume</code> and <code>HasFundamentaData</code>. Typical examples of filter functions you might want sound like: 
<ul>
 <li>Take 500 stocks worth more than $10, with more than $10M daily trading volume.</li>
 <li>Take 10 stocks above their 200-Day EMA with more than $1B daily trading volume.</li>
</ul>
