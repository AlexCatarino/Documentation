<p>
	Warming up your algorithm causes data from before the algorithm starts to be fed into the conventional data event handlers. This system of warm up lends itself to stream style algorithms.
</p>
<p>
	The data flowing to your algorithm will seamlessly pass from historical to live data. The flag <code>bool IsWarmingUp</code> can be used to monitor this transition.
</p>
<p>
	During the warm up period you cannot submit orders. Warm up also does not support universe selection while the algorithm is warming up.
