QuantConnect allows you to request historical data in many different formats. In this section we'll cover each of these formats and how you can use them in your algorithm. Broadly, there are two ways to use these data requests: direct historical data requests, and indirect algorithm warm up.

A direct historical data request will fetch any historical you request, at any time. This gives you the most control to apply the data as you need. Indirect algorithm warm up winds back the start time of your algorthm and feeds it with historical data, simulating a real datafeed. This is best for quickly restoring state of a fixed sets of assets.
