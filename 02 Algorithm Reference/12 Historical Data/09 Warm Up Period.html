<p>
In addition to the methods for manually requesting history above, QuantConnect also supports an automated "fast-forward" system called "Warm Up" which simulates winding back the clock from the time the algorithm is deployed. In a backest this is the StartDate of your algorithm. Warmup is a great way to prepare indicators for relatively simple strategies, but if you have a dynamic universe of assets we recommend manually requesting historical data when required. 
</p>

<p>
The Warm Up API supports a set number of bars, or a period based warm up. Warmup should be called in your <code>Initialize()</code> method. An example of using warm up can be found <a target="_BLANK" href="https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean/blob/master/Algorithm.Python/WarmupAlgorithm.py#L50">here</a>. 
</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="csharp"> // Wind time back 7 days from start:
SetWarmup(TimeSpan.FromDays(7));

// Feed in 100 bars before start date:
SetWarmup(100);
</pre>
<pre class="python"> # Wind time back 7 days from start:
self.SetWarmup(timedelta(7))

# Feed in 100 bars before start date:
self.SetWarmup(100)
</pre>
</div>

<h4>Distinguishing Warmup from Reality</h4>
<p>
Your algorithm may need to distinguish warm up data from real data. QuantConnect makes this possible with a boolean flag <span class="csharp">$[IsWarmingUp,P:QuantConnect.Algorithm.QCAlgorithm.IsWarmingUp]</span><span class="python">self.IsWarmingUp</span>. A common application of this property might look like this: 
</p>
<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="csharp">// In Initialize
var emaFast = EMA("IBM", 50);
var emaSlow = EMA("IBM", 100);
SetWarmup(100);

// In OnData: Don't run if we're warming up our indicators.
if (IsWarmingUp) return;
</pre>
<pre class="python"># In Initialize
self.emaFast = self.EMA("IBM", 50);
self.emaSlow = self.EMA("IBM", 100);
self.SetWarmup(100);

// In OnData: Don't run if we're warming up our indicators.
if self.IsWarmingUp: return
</pre>
</div>

<h4>Warmup Limitations</h4>
<p>
Algorithm Warmup is useful if you have a streaming algorithm which can incrementally build algorithm state however it has several limitations:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Trades cannot be performed during warm up as they would impact the algorithm portfolio and would be trading on fictional fast-forwarded data.</li>
<li>Due to technical limitations Universe selection cannot be fast-forwarded. Any universe selection is skipped until realtime is reached.</li>
</ul>
