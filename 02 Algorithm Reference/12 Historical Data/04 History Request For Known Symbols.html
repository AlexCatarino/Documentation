<p>The simplest form of history request is for a known set of Symbols. This is common for fixed universes of securities, or when you'd like to warm up new securities added to your algorithm.
</p>

<p class="python">
History requests for a known set of Symbols return a Data Frame. Each row of the Data Frame represents the prices at a point of time. Each <i>column</i> of the Data Frame is a property of that price data (e.g. open, high, low, close). 
</p>

<p class="csharp">
History requests return slightly different data depending on if you ask with 1-Symbol or an array of Symbols. With 1-Symbol you get an array of the security data. With multiple security history requests, we cannot guarantee all the data types are the same format, so we return an array of Slices instead. E.g. A history request for FX-QuoteBars + Equity-TradeBars is returned as an array of Slices; where the FX data is located under <code>slices.QuoteBars</code>, and the Equity data is under <code>slices.Bars</code>.
</p>

<p>
History API calls follow the following pattern: <code class="python">self.History(symbol, bar_count, resolution = null)</code> <code class="csharp">History&lt;Type&gt;(Symbol symbol, int barCount, Resolution resolution = null)</code>.
</p>


<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="python"># Requesting By Bar Count: 14 IBM TradeBars 

self.df = self.History(self.Symbol("IBM"), 7)
self.df = self.History(self.Symbol("IBM"), 14, Resolution.Minute)


# Requestion By Period: 2 Weeks Of IBM Data

self.df = self.History(self.Symbol("IBM"), timedelta(14))
self.df = self.History(self.Symbol("IBM"), timedelta(14), Resolution.Minute)
</pre>
<pre class="csharp fsharp">// Requesting By Bar Count: 14 IBM TradeBars
var bars = History&lt;TradeBar&gt;("IBM", 14);
var bars = History&lt;TradeBar&gt;("IBM", 14, Resolution.Minute);

// Requestion By Period: 2 Weeks Of IBM Data
var bars = History&lt;TradeBar&gt;("IBM", TimeSpan.FromDays(14));
var bars = History&lt;TradeBar&gt;("IBM", TimeSpan.FromDays(14), Resolution.Minute);

<p> Simple, single security requests are generally best for a fixed set or manual universe of assets. The data you can request using this method depends on the security type. The table below shows the currently supported data types available in QuantConnect.
