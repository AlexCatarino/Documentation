<h4>Local Deployments</h4>
<p>When you deploy local algorithms, you can use any of the following data feeds:</p>
<ul>
    <li>IQFeed</li>
    <li>Polygon</li>
    <li>A data feed from your brokerage</li>
</ul>

<p>When you <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/historical-data/history-requests'>request historical data</a> in local algorithms, the historical data comes from your data feed vendor. Familiarize yourself with their quotas and limits to avoid errors.</p>

<h4>Cloud Deployments</h4>
<p>When you deploy algorithms to QuantConnect Cloud, you can use any of <a href='/docs/v2/cloud-platform/live-trading/data-feeds'>the data feeds we support in the cloud</a>, including SIP, CTA, CME, and select brokerages. Your live algorithms run on our co-located servers that have 10 GB transfer speeds and low latency.
