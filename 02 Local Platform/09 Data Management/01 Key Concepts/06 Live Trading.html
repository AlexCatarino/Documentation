<p>You need live data feeds to inject data into your algorithm so that you can make real-time trading decisions and so that the values of the securities in your portfolio are updated. The data feeds you have available to you depend on where you deploy the algorithm. When you <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/historical-data/history-requests'>request historical data</a> in local algorithms, the historical data comes from your data feed vendor. Familiarize yourself with the quotas and limits of your data feed to avoid errors.</p>

<h4>Local Deployments</h4>
<p>When you deploy local algorithms, you can use any of the following data feeds:</p>
<ul>
    <li>IQFeed</li>
    <p>To view the asset classes that our IQFeed integration supports, see <a href='/docs/v2/lean-cli/live-trading/data-feeds/iqfeed#03-Supported-Assets'>Supported Assets</a>.</p>
    <li>Polygon</li>
    <p>To view the asset classes that our Polygon integration supports, see <a href='/docs/v2/lean-cli/live-trading/data-feeds/polygon#03-Supported-Assets'>Supported Assets</a>.</p>
    <li><a href='/docs/v2/cloud-platform/live-trading/data-feeds/brokerage-data-feeds'>A brokerage data feed</a></li>
</ul>

<h4>Cloud Deployments</h4>
<p>When you deploy algorithms to QuantConnect Cloud, you can use any of <a href='/docs/v2/cloud-platform/live-trading/data-feeds'>the data feeds we support in the cloud</a>, including SIP, CTA, CME, and select brokerages. Your live algorithms run on our co-located servers that have 10 GB transfer speeds and low latency.</p>
