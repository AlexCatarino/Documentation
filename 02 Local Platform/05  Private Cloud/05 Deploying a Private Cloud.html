<p>To deploy a private cloud, use the following steps:</p>

<p>
  <b>Setting up a Master Work Server:</b>
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Follow the following tutorial to <a href="/docs/v2/lean-cli/key-concepts/getting-started">install and authenticate the LEAN CLI</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Run the LEAN CLI command  <code>lean deploy private-cloud --master</code> to start a work queue and listen for jobs from the team.<br/>
    If you are setting up a single server, this is all you need to do.
  </li>
  
  <li>
    To expand the private cluster further so work is distributed across many servers, install the LEAN CLI into the second server and run: <code>lean deploy private-cloud --slave</code>code>. <br/>
    This will spin up the second work-server to consume jobs.
  </li>
