<p>An organization workspace is a directory that contains a <span class="public-file-name">data</span> directory, a Lean configuration file, and all your project files from one of your organizations. You can have a separate organization workspace directory for each organization you're a member of on QuantConnect. These directories need a <span class="public-file-name">data</span> directory and a Lean configuration file in order to locally run the LEAN engine.</p>
