<p>The Local Platform enables you to seamlessly develop quant strategies on-premise and in QuantConnect Cloud, getting the best of both environments. With Local Platform, you can harness your local version control, autocomplete, and coding tools with the full power of a scalable cloud at your finger tips. We intend to keep complete feature parity with our cloud environment, allowing you to harness cloud or local datasets to power on-premise quantitative research.</p>

<p>We encourage a hybrid "cloud + local" workflow, so you can use right tool for each stage of your development process. With the Local Platform, you can create, debug, and run projects on premise while using your own on-site tools. With the Cloud Platform you can deploy backtests at scale and harness our massive data library at low cost.</p>

<p>The deployment target setting allows you to switch modes from local to cloud platforms, choosing where you run your algorithm. Local Platform targets are denoted with blue icons and Cloud Platform targets are denoted with gold icons.</p>
