<p>When you save your local projects and push them to QuantConnect Cloud, it only pushes the Python, C#, and notebook files in your project. Projects can contain many other file types like <span class='public-file-name'>json</span>, <span class='public-file-name'>csv</span>, and <span class='public-file-name'>html</span>, but the local platform only pushes your <span class='public-file-name'>py</span>, <span class='public-file-name'>cs</span>, and <span class='public-file-name'>ipynb</span> files.</p>
