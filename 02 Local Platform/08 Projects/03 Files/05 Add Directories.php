<p>You can organize the code and notebook files in your project into directories to make navigating them easier. For example, if you have multiple <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/algorithm-framework/alpha/key-concepts'>Alpha models</a> in your strategy, you can create an <span class='public-directory-name'>alphas</span> directory in your project to hold a file for each Alpha model.</p>
