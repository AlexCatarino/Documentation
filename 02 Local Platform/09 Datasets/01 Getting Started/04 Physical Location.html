<p>When you download data from the Dataset Market, it's stored in the <span class="public-directory-name">data</span> directory in your <a href="/docs/v2/local-platform/development-environment/organization-workspaces">organization workspace</a>. This is the same directory that LEAN reads data from when you run an algorithm or spin up a research notebook. To change the directory from which LEAN reads the data, open the <a href='/docs/v2/local-platform/development-environment/configuration#03-LEAN-Settings'>configuration file</a> and adjust the value under the <code>data-folder</code> key. The data folder should be fast and spacious. Follow these steps to check the approximate size of the datasets in the Dataset Market:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the <a href='/docs/v2/lean-cli/datasets/quantconnect/download-in-bulk'>Download in Bulk</a> page.</li>
  <li>Click a dataset.</li>
  <li>Scroll down to the <span class='page-section-name'>Size and Format</span> section.</li>
</ol>
