<p>You need live data providers to inject data into your algorithm so that you can make real-time trading decisions and so that the values of the securities in your portfolio are updated. The data providers you have available to you depend on where you deploy the algorithm. When you <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/historical-data/history-requests'>request historical data</a> in local algorithms, the historical data comes from your dataset vendor. Familiarize yourself with the quotas and limits of your data provider to avoid errors.</p>

<h4>Local Deployments</h4>
<p>When you deploy local algorithms, you can use any of the following data providers:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href='/docs/v2/cloud-platform/datasets'>A brokerage data provider</a></li>
    <p>These are streams of live security prices that come directly from your brokerage.</p>
    <li>IQFeed</li>
    <p>To view the asset classes that our IQFeed integration supports, see <a href='/docs/v2/lean-cli/live-trading/data-providers/iqfeed#04-Supported-Assets'>Supported Assets</a>.</p>
    <li>Polygon</li>
    <p>To view the asset classes that our Polygon integration supports, see <a href='/docs/v2/lean-cli/live-trading/data-providers/polygon#04-Supported-Assets'>Supported Assets</a>.</p>
</ul>

<h4>Cloud Deployments</h4>
<p>When you deploy algorithms to QuantConnect Cloud, you can use any of <a href='/docs/v2/cloud-platform/datasets'>the data providers we support in the cloud</a>. Your live algorithms run on our co-located servers that have 10 GB transfer speeds and low latency.</p>
