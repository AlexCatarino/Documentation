<p>
  To use Polygon data in the Research Environment on Local Platform, first <a href='/docs/v2/lean-cli/datasets/polygon#03-Research'>start the Research Environment with the CLI</a> and <a href='/docs/v2/research-environment/datasets/key-concepts'>request the data you need</a>. 
  All the data you request will be cached in your hard drive, so you can then <a href='/docs/v2/local-platform/research/getting-started#03-Open-Notebooks'>open the Research Environment with the Local Platform UX</a> and access it.
