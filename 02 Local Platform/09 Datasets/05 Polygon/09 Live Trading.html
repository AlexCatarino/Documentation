<p>The Polygon data provider is not currently supported for live trading on Local Platform.</p>

<p>If you deploy local live algorithms that trade US Equities or US Equity Options, you'll need to periodically update your US Equity Security Master. Weekly updates are sufficient in most cases.</p>

<p>If you deploy local live algorithms that rely on US Equity universe data, you'll need to download the latest data files every trading day. For an example Python script that updates local US Equity Coarse Universe files, see <a href='/docs/v2/lean-cli/datasets/quantconnect/download-in-bulk/us-equity-coarse-universe#03-Download-Daily-Updates'>Download Daily Updates</a>. For an example Python script that updates local US ETF Constituents files, see <a href='/docs/v2/lean-cli/datasets/quantconnect/download-in-bulk/us-etf-constituents#03-Download-Daily-Updates'>Download Daily Updates</a>. To update <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/universes/equity/alternative-data-universes#02-Supported-Datasets'>alternative datasets that support universe selection</a>, see the CLI commands in their respective dataset listing.</p>
