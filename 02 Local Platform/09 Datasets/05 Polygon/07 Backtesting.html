  To run a local backtest on Local Platform with Polygon data, first <a href='/docs/v2/lean-cli/datasets/polygon#02-Backtesting'>backtest the algorithm on your local machine with the CLI</a>.
  All the data your backtest requests will be cached in your hard drive, so you can then <a href='/docs/v2/local-platform/backtesting/getting-started#02-Run-Backtests'>run the backtest on your local machine with the Local Platform UX</a> and access it.
