<p>The Polygon data feed comes directly from Polygon. For more information about the data source, see the <a rel='nofollow' target='_blank' href='https://polygon.io/docs/stocks'>Polygon API documentation</a>.</p>

<p>If you use the Polygon data provider, Polygon only provides the security price data. If you trade US Equities or US Equity Options, you'll also need to <a href='/datasets/quantconnect-us-equity-security-master/cli'>download the US Equity Security Master with the CLI</a>.</p>
