<p>To save notebooks, press <span class='key-combination'>CTRL+S</span>.</p>

<p>When you save a notebook, it saves the content of the cells. If you <a href='/docs/v2/local-platform/research/getting-started#05-Stop-Nodes'>stop the Research Environment node</a> or even just <a href='/docs/v2/local-platform/projects/files#07-Close-Files'>close the notebook</a>, when you <a href='/docs/v2/local-platform/research/getting-started#03-Open-Notebooks'>open the notebook</a> again, you'll see the cell output. However, if you stop the Research Environment node and <a href='/docs/v2/local-platform/projects/getting-started#05-Close-Projects'>close the project</a>, you'll need to run the cells again to generate the output.</p>
