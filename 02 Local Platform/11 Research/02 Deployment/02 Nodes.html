<p>A <span class='new-term'>node</span> is a term to describe the compute hardware when your notebook runs. We create "virtual nodes", which enable you to spin up multiple research notebook with your on-premise hardware and data. When you run multiple notebooks, each one runs in a separate container on the same host machine. To view all your virtual nodes, see the <a href='/docs/v2/local-platform/development-environment/resource-management'>Resources panel</a>.</p>
