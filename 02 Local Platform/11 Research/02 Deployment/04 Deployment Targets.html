<p>Local Platform provides multiple deployment targets to enable you to <a href='/docs/v2/local-platform/research/getting-started#03-Open-Notebooks'>open notebooks</a> on-premise and in QuantConnect Cloud.</p>

<h4>Local</h4>
<p>If you use the <a href='/docs/v2/local-platform/key-concepts/deployment-targets#02-Local'>Local Platform deployment target</a> when you open a notebook, the notebook runs on your local hardware and uses <a href='/docs/v2/local-platform/development-environment/organization-workspaces#07-Directory-Structure'>the data in your organization workspace</a>.</p>

<h4>Cloud</h4>
<p>If you use the <a href='/docs/v2/local-platform/key-concepts/deployment-targets#03-Cloud'>Cloud Platform deployment target</a> when you open a notebook, the notebook runs on your local hardware and uses the <a href='/datasets'>our cloud datasets</a>. The cloud Research Environment may not be used to export cloud datasets.</p>
