<p>The backtest results page and the <span class='public-directory-name'>backtests</span> directory in your project show your algorithm's performance. Review the results to see how your algorithm has performed during the backtest and to investigate how you might improve your algorithm before live trading. For more information about backtest results, see <a href='/docs/v2/local-platform/backtesting/results'>Results</a>.</p>
