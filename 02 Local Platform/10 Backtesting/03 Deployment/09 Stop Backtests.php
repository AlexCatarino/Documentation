<p>To stop a running backtest, open the <a href="/docs/v2/local-platform/projects/ide#07-Manage-Nodes">Resources panel</a>, and then click the <span class="icon-name">stop</span> icon next to the backtest node. You can stop nodes that you are using, but to stop cloud nodes that your team members are using, you need <a href="/docs/v2/cloud-platform/organizations/members#08-Permissions">stop node permissions</a>.</p>
