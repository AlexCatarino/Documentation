<p>A <span class='new-term'>node</span> is a term to describe the compute hardware when your algorithm runs. We create "virtual nodes", which enable you to spin up multiple backtests with your on-premise hardware. When you run multiple backtests, each one runs in a separate container on the same host machine. To view all your virtual nodes, see the <a href='/docs/v2/local-platform/development-environment/resource-management'>Resources panel</a>.</p>
