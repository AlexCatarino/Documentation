<p>Concurrent backtesting is the process of running multiple backtests at the same time. Concurrent backtesting speeds up your strategy development because you don't have to wait while a single backtest finishes executing.</p>

<p>If you deploy local backtests, you can run as many concurrent backtests as your CPU and RAM will handle. </p>

<p>If you deploy cloud backtests, you need multiple <a href='/docs/v2/cloud-platform/organizations/resources#02-Backtesting-Nodes'>backtesting nodes</a> in your organization to run concurrent backtests. The more backtesting nodes that your organization has, the more concurrent backtests you can execute. If you are trying to fine-tune your <a href="/docs/v2/local-platform/projects/structure#06-Parameters">parameters</a>, consider running a <a href="/docs/v2/local-platform/optimization">parameter optimization</a>. If you run a parameter optimization job, you can run multiple backtests concurrently without having multiple backtest nodes.</p>
