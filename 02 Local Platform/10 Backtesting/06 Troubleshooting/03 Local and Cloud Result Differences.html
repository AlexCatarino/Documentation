<p>If your algorithm produces different results when you backtest it in QuantConnect Cloud versus on-premise, it's usually because of differences in data. For example, if you don't have the latest version of the <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/datasets/quantconnect/us-equity-security-master'>US Equity Security Master</a>, you will likely be missing some splits and dividends, which impact the historical prices of adjusted data. In this case, to avoid issues, update the US Equity Security Master every day. For more information about downloading data from the Dataset Market so you have the same data on-premise as in QuantConnect Cloud, see <a href='/docs/v2/local-platform/data-management/downloading-data'>Downloading Data</a>.</p>
