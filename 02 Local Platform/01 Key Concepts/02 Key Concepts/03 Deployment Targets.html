<p>We encourage a hybrid "cloud + local" workflow, so you can use right tool for each stage of your development process. With the Local Platform, you can create, debug, and run projects on premise while using your own on-site tools. With the Cloud Platform you can deploy backtests at scale and harness our massive data library at low cost.</p>

<p>The deployment target setting allows you to switch modes from local to cloud platforms, choosing where you run your algorithm. Local platform targets are denoted with blue icons and cloud platform targets are denoted with gold icons.</p>

<h4>Local Platform</h4>
<p>The Local deployment target is your local machine. Follow these steps to set the deployment target of a project on the local platform to your local environment:</p>

<ol>
    <li><a href='/docs/v2/local-platform/projects/getting-started#03-Create-Projects'>Create a project</a> or <a href='/docs/v2/local-platform/projects/getting-started#04-Open-Projects'>open an exisiting one</a>.</li>
    <li>In the Project panel, click the <span class='field-name'>Deployment Target</span> field and then click <span class='button-name'>Local</span> from the drop-down menu.</li>
</ol>

<p>After you set the deployment target to your local machine, the <img class='inline-icon' src="https://cdn.quantconnect.com/i/tu/local-platform-build-button.png"> <span class='button-name'>Build</span> and <img class='inline-icon' src='https://cdn.quantconnect.com/i/tu/local-backtest.png'> <span class='button-name'>Backtest</span> icons are blue.</p>

<h4>Cloud Platform</h4>
<p>The Cloud deployment target is a collection of servers that the QuantConnect team manages. It's the same deployment target you use if you create projects, spin up research nodes, and deploy algorithms on the QuantConnect website. Follow these steps to set the deployment target of a project on the local platform to Cloud:</p>

<ol>
    <li><a href="/docs/v2/local-platform/projects/getting-started#03-Create-Projects">Create a project</a> or <a href="/docs/v2/local-platform/projects/getting-started#04-Open-Projects">open an exisiting one</a>.</li>
    <li>In the Project panel, click the <span class="field-name">Deployment Target</span> field and then click <span class="button-name">Cloud</span> from the drop-down menu.</li>
</ol>

<p>After you set the deployment target to Cloud, the <img class="inline-icon" src="https://cdn.quantconnect.com/i/tu/build-button.png"> <span class="button-name">Build</span> and <img class="inline-icon" src="https://cdn.quantconnect.com/i/tu/backtest-button.png"> <span class="button-name">Backtest</span> icons are orange.</p>
