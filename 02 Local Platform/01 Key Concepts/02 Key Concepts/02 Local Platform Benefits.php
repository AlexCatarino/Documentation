<p>The following sections explain the main benefits of the local platform.</p>

<h4>Hybrid Workflow</h4>
<p>The local platform lets you run backtests, deploy research notebooks, and deploy live algorithms on your local machine and in QuantConnect Cloud.</p>

<h4>Data Access</h4>
<p>If you run local algorithms, you can download our cloud datasets or utilize your local data. If you run your algorithms in the cloud, you can access our rich library of datasets.</p>

<h4>Version Control</h4>
<p>The local platform syncs your local and cloud project files. If you pull your cloud projects to your local machine, you can use your own version control systems to track project changes.</p>

<h4>Self-Soverign Security</h4>
<p>The local platform offers you the ability to take ownership of your project security. On the Insitution tier, you can create local workspaces and projects without pushing them to QuantConnect Cloud.</p>

<h4>On-Premise Compute</h4>
<p>The local platform enables you to run backtests, deploy research notebooks, and deploy live algorithms on your local hardware.</p>
