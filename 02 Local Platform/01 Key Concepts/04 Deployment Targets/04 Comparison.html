<p>Note the following differences between the Local Platform and Cloud Platform deployment targets.</p>

<h4>Data</h4>
<p>The Local Platform target uses your <a href='/docs/v2/local-platform/datasets/getting-started'>on-premise data</a>. The Cloud Platform target has access to the data in the <a href='/datasets'>Dataset Market</a>. Both targets enable you to <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/importing-data/key-concepts'>import custom datasets</a>.</p>

<h4>Compute</h4>
<p>The Local Platform target uses your on-premise hardware. The Cloud Platform target uses the QuantConnect Cloud compute. For more information about the backtesting, research, and live trading nodes in QuantConnect Cloud, see <a href='/docs/v2/cloud-platform/organizations/resources'>Resources</a>.</p>

<h4>Management</h4>
<p>The Local Platform target is under the management of your on-premise team. The Cloud Platform target is under the management of the QuantConnect team.</p>

<h4>Hardware Procurement</h4>
<p>The Local Platform target uses your on-premise hardware, so it requires you to procure and management your own hardware. The Cloud Platform target uses the hardware in QuantConnect Cloud, so you don't need to procure or manage any of the hardware.</p>
