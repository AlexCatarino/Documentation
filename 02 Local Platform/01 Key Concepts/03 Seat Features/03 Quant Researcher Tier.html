<p>Organizations on the Quant Researcher tier have access to the local platform to run cloud backtests, optimizations, and live trading algorithms. The local platform syncs your local and cloud project files, so if you pull your cloud projects to your local machine, you can use your own version control systems to track project changes. For more information about the features of this tier in QuantConnect Cloud, see <a href='/docs/v2/cloud-platform/organizations/tier-features#03-Quant-Researcher-Tier'>Quant Researcher Tier</a></p>
