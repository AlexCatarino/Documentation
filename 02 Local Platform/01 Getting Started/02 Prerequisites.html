<p>Our local platform requires Docker and the LEAN CLI. When you launch the local platform, we scan for these projects and prompt you to install them to continue. We run all algorithms in a Docker container to avoid installing any dependencies on your computer. The LEAN CLI is required to simplify the interactions with the cloud.</p>
