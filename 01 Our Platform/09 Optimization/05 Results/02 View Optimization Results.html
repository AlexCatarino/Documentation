<p>The optimization results page automatically displays when you launch an optimization job. The page presents the algorithm's equity curves, parameters, target values, server statistics, and much more information.</p>

<p>The content in the optimization results page updates as your optimization job executes. You can close or refresh the window without interrupting the job because the optimization nodes processes on our servers. If you close the page, you can view all of the project's optimizations to open the page again.</p>
