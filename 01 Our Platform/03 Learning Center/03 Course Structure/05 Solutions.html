<p>A solution file for each task is available in the Learning Center environment. You may use it, but we recommend that you try to solve the problem before you check the solution file. You'll learn best by solving the problem on your own. However, errors can occur when running backtests, so you may use the solution file to ensure the environment is running without error.</p>
