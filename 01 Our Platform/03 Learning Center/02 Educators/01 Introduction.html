<p>Educators are QuantConnect experts who contribute courses to the Learning Center. We are always looking for experts to become Educators and share their insight with the community. As an Educator, you create the description, requirements, and lessons of each course you contribute. You also provide the images for the course listing in the Learning Center. As students complete your course, you'll receive course reviews so you can improve your course material.</p>
