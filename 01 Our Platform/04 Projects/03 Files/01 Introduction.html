<p>The files in your projects enable you to implement trading algorithms, perform research, and store important information. The IDE lets you create, manage, and store the files in your projects. Python projects start with a <span class='public-file-name'>main.py</span> and a <span class='public-file-name'>research.ipynb</span> file. C# projects start with a <span class='public-file-name'>Main.cs</span> and a <span class='public-file-name'>Research.ipynb</span> file. Use the <span class='public-file-name'>main.py</span> or <span class='public-file-name'>Main.cs</span> file to implement trading algorithms and use the <span class='public-file-name'>ipynb</span> file to access the Research Environment.</p>
