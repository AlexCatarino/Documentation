<p>You can't edit the code files in your project while in builder mode. To exit builder mode, at the top of the IDE, click the <span class="tab-name">Strategy Builder</span> tab and then click <span class="button-name">Exit Builder Mode</span>. If you just close the <span class="tab-name">Strategy Builder</span> tab, you will still be in builder mode. After you exit builder mode, you can edit your code files. </p>
