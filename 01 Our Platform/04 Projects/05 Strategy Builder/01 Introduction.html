<p>The Strategy Builder is a convenient tool to include individual algorithm framework modules in a new project without writing any code. Each of the modules in the Strategy Builder contains a description and list of the pre-selected settings for the module. The following image shows the Strategy Builder module catalog:</p>

<p>Add modules in the catalog and they will be added to your algorithm. The modules you add are accessible in your code files, but their&nbsp; class definitions aren't. Instead, you can see the definitions in the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean">Lean GitHub repository</a>.<br></p>

<p>The Strategy Builder streamlines your development process. It's an easy way to get familiar with using the API to create trading strategies without writing any code. The number of framework modules available in the Strategy Builder is an ever-growing list, so its functionality grows over time. If you prefer not to use the Strategy builder, you can disable it so it doesn't display when you create new projects.</p>
