<p>The Strategy Builder is a convenient tool to include individual algorithm framework modules in a new project without writing any code. It's an easy way to get familiar with using the API to create trading strategies. The number of framework modules available in the Strategy Builder is an ever-growing list, so its functionality grows over time. If you prefer not to use the Strategy builder, you can disable it so it doesn't display when you create new projects.</p>
