<p>An environment is everything that's installed on a machine where a program is executing. The Lean cloud image that runs the backtesting, research, and live trading nodes in QC Cloud is the latest master branch on the Lean GitHub repository. In some cases, you may want to use a different branch to run your algorithms and reference custom libraries. If you are in a Trading Firm or Institution organization, you can execute Lean using other branches.</p>
