<p>The Lean engine supports C# and Python. The engine is written in C#, so it is the native language. However, Python is supported using Python.NET. Comparing the languages, C# is faster than Python and it's easier to contribute to Lean if you have features written in C# modules. In contrast, Python is less verbose, has more third-party libraries, and is more popular among the QuantConnect community than C#. Python is also the native language for the research notebooks, so it's easier to use in the Research Environment.</p>

<p>The programming language that you have set on your account determines how <a href='/docs/v2/our-platform/user-guides/projects/ide#03-Autocomplete-and-Intellisense'>autocomplete and IntelliSense</a> are verified and determines the types of files that are included in your new projects. If you have Python set as your programming language, new projects will have <span class='public-file-name'>.py</span> files. If you have C# set as your programming language, new projects will have <span class='public-file-name'>.cs</span> files.</p>
