<p>Additional methods of collaboration include cloning, sharing, and migrating projects.</p>

<h4>Cloning Projects</h4>
<p>Clone a project to create a new copy of the project and save it within the same organization. When you clone a project, the project files are duplicated but the backtest results and the content stored in the ObjectStore is not retained. Cloning enables you to test small changes in your projects before merging the changes back into the original project. Cloning also enables you to clear ObjectStore storage while keeping the project files because you can clone the project and then <a href="/docs/v2/our-platform/projects/project-management#10-Delete-Projects">delete the original version of the project</a>.</p>

<p>To clone projects, <a href="/docs/v2/our-platform/projects/project-management#02-View-All-Projects">open the project</a> you want to clone and then, in the Project panel, click <span class="button-name">Clone</span>. "Project cloned successfully" displays.</p>

<h4>Sharing Projects</h4>
<p><a href="/docs/v2/our-platform/backtesting/deployment#08-Run-Backtests">Run a backtest</a> and then <a href="/docs/v2/our-platform/backtesting/results#14-Share-Results">make the backtest results public</a> to share a project. Once a backtest is made public, a link is generated for you that opens the backtest results and the project files. You can directly give the link to others, attach the backtest to a forum discussion, or embed the backtest into a website. However, note that when you make a backtest public, the project files are accessible to anyone who visits the link, even after you delete the project. As a result, we do not recommend collaborating on projects by making backtests public and sharing the link with the people with which you are collaborating. Instead, we recommend adding team members to your project since doing so protects your intellectual property.</p>

<p>You can share a backtest at any time when it's executing. Although, if you generate a link to share the backtest before the backtest completes, the link that's generated will not contain all of the backtest results. Some reasons to share your project include the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Attach the project to the forum to ask for help, gather feedback, or report an issue.</li>
    <li>Attach the project to a data issue to reduce the amount of time it takes to fix the data issue.</li>
    <li>Share a link to the project with others to give them a copy of the project files and the backtest results.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Migrating Projects</h4>
<p>Migrate a project to clone the project and move the cloned version of the project from an organization that you own to another organization of which you're a member. You must be the organization administrator to migrate projects out of the organization. Migrate a project to run the project using resources from a different organization and to collaborate on the project with members from a different organization. When you migrate projects, the project files are copied but the content stored in the ObjectStore is not retained. </p>

<p>Follow these steps to migrate projects:</p>
<ol>
    <li><a href="/docs/v2/our-platform/projects/project-management#02-View-All-Projects">Open the project</a> you want to migrate.</li>
    <li>In the project panel, click <span class="button-name">Migrate</span>.</li>
    <li>Click the name of the organization to which you want to migrate the project and then click <span class="button-name">Migrate</span>.</li>
    <p>The top navigation bar displays <span class="button-name">Connected as: <span class="placeholder-text">theOrganizationYouMigratedTo</span></span>.</p>
</ol>
