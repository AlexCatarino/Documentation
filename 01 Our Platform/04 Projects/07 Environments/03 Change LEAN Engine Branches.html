<p>Follow these steps to change the Lean engine branch that's used to run your backtests and live trading algorithms:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Open the project for which you want to change the Lean engine branch.</li>
    <li>In the project panel, click <span class='button-name'>LEAN Engine (<span class='placeholder-text'>languageName</span>): <span class='placeholder-text'>branchName</span> (<span class='placeholder-text'>hash</span>)</span>.</li>
    <li>Click the branch that's currently used and then select the new branch.</li>
    <li>If you want to always use the master branch, select the <span class='button-name'>Always use Master Branch</span> check box.</li>
    <li>Click <span class='button-name'>Save</span>.</li>
    <p>"Project Lean version saved" displays.</p>
</ol>

<p>Changing the Lean engine branch only affects the current project. If you <a href='/docs/v2/our-platform/tutorials/projects/managing-projects#03-Create-New-Projects'>create a new project</a>, the new project will use the master branch by default.</p>
