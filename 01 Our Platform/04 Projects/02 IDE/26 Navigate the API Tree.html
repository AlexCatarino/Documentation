<p>Follow these steps to work with the API tree:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Open a project.</li>
    <li>On the right side of the IDE, click <span class='button-name'>API</span> to open the API tree panel.</li>
    <li>In the search bar at the top of the API tree panel, enter the name of a <code>QCAlgorithm</code> base class member to search the API tree.</li>
    <li>Click on a member name in the API tree to expand and collapse the details of that member.</li>
    <p>If the member you select returns a class (for example, <code class="python">self.Universe</code><code class="csharp">Universe</code>), then the members of the class are added to the API tree.</p>
