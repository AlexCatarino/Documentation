<p>After you launch the debugger, you can inspect the state of your algorithm as it executes each line of code. You can inspect local variables or custom expressions.</p>

<h4>Local Variables</h4>
<p>The <span class="page-section-name">Variables</span> section of the Run and Debug panel shows the local variables at the current breakpoint. If a variable in the panel is an object, click it to see its members. The panel updates as the algorithm runs.</p>

<p>Follow these steps to update the value of a variable:</p>
<ol>
    <li>In the Run and Debug panel, right-click a variable and then click <span class='menu-name'>Set Value</span>.</li>
    <li>Enter the new value and then press <span class='key-combinations'>Enter</span>.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Custom Expressions</h4>
<p>The <span class="page-section-name">Watch</span> section of the Run and Debug panel shows the custom expressions you add. For example, you can add an expression to show the current date in the backtest.</p>
