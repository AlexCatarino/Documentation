<p>To run a backtest, <a href="/docs/v2/our-platform/tutorials/projects/managing-projects#05-Open-Existing-Projects">open the project</a> that you want to backtest and then click the <span class='icon-name'>Backtest</span> <img style='height: 24px' src='https://cdn.quantconnect.com/i/tu/backtest-button.png'> icon. If the project builds successfully, "New backtest: <span class='placeholder-text'>projectName</span> is in the queue" displays. You can refresh or close the page while the backtest is executing without interfering with it because the backtest runs on our cloud servers.</p>
