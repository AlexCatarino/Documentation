<p>If you have the <a href="/docs/v2/our-platform/tutorials/community/managing-your-profile#06-Edit-Code-Settings">Automatic Builds setting</a> enabled, your projects will automatically build after each keystroke. To manually build a project, <a href="/docs/v2/our-platform/tutorials/projects/managing-projects#05-Open-Existing-Projects">open the project</a> that you want to build and then click the&nbsp;<span class="button-name">Build</span> <img style="height: 24px" src="https://cdn.quantconnect.com/i/tu/build-button.png">&nbsp;icon. If the build process is unresponsive, try refreshing the page and building again. If the build process continues to be unresponsive, check our <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://status.quantconnect.com/">Status page</a> or <a href="/contact">contact us</a>. If the compiler finds errors during the build process, the IDE highlights the lines of code that caused the errors.</p>
