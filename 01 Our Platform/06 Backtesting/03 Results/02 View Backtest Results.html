<p>The backtest results page automatically displays when you deploy a backtest. The backtest results page presents the equity curve, trades, trades, logs, performance statistics, and much more information.</p>

<p>The content in the backtest results page updates as your backtest executes. You can close or refresh the window without interrupting the backtest because the backtesting node processes on our servers. Unless you explicitly make the backtest public, only you can view its results. If you delete a backtest result or you are inactive for 12 months, we archive your backtest results.</p>
