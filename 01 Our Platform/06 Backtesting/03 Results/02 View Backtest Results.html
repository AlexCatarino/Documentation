<p>The content in the backtest results page is updated as your backtest executes. You can close or refresh the window without interrupting the backtesting node because the node is processing on our servers. Unless you explicitly make the backtest public, only you can view your backtest results. The following table describes the functionality of each tab at the bottom of the backtest results page:</p>

<table class="qc-table table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="width: 25%">Tab</th>
      <th style="width: 75%">Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><span class="tab-name">Overview</span></td>
      <td>Various statistics on the backtest performance.</td>
    </tr>

      <td>Create a <a href="/docs/v2/our-platform/user-guides/report/backtesting">backtest report</a>.</td>

    <tr>
      <td><span class="tab-name">Orders</span></td>
      <td>A table of orders that occurred in the backtest.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><span class="tab-name">Logs</span></td>
      <td>The logs generated through the backtesting, including error messages, debug statements, quit statements.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><span class="tab-name">Code</span></td>
      <td>The project files that were used to deploy the backtest.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><span class="tab-name">Share</span></td>
      <td>Make the backtest public and generate links to <a href="/docs/v2/our-platform/user-guides/backtesting/results#09-Sharing">share the results</a>.</td>

<p>We give an arbitrary name (for example, "Smooth Apricot Chicken") to your backtest result files, but you can <a href="/docs/v2/our-platform/tutorials/backtesting/managing-backtests#06-Rename-Backtests">rename them</a>. If you <a href="/docs/v2/our-platform/tutorials/backtesting/managing-backtests#08-Delete-Backtests">delete a backtest result</a> or you are inactive for 12 months, we archive your backtest results. If you share a backtest result, it's public domain and always stored.<br></p>
