<p>Dataset categories are a way to identify different types of datasets in our Dataset Market. We provide many price, fundamental, and alternative datasets for you to use in your research and trading. Datasets that include factors outside of the security price are less researched, so they may have more alpha to discover. Incorporate alternative datasets into your algorithms so that you can make more informed trading decisions.</p>
