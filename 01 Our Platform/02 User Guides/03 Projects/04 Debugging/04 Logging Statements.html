<p>Logging statements are statements that you can add to your algorithm in order to add information to the log file, add information to the Console, or even quit execution. Use these statements to debug your backtests and live algorithms. Consider adding them in the code block of an <code>if</code> statement to signify an error has been caught. <br></p>

<h4>Log</h4>
<p>Log statements are added to the log file while your algorithm continues executing. Logging dataset information is not permitted. Use <code>Log</code> statements to debug your backtests and live trading algorithms. Log length is capped by organization tier. If your organization hits the daily limit, <a href="/contact">contact us</a>. Furthermore, if multiple messages are sent with the same content, only the first message is added to the log file. Add a timestamp to your log messages to bypass this rate-limiting.</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
    <pre class="csharp">Log("My log message");</pre>
    <pre class="python">self.Log("My log message")</pre>
</div>

<h4>Debug</h4>
<p>Debug statements are the same as log statements, but <code>Debug</code> statements are displayed in green text in the Console. Use these statements when you want to give more attention to a message in the Console. Debug messages are capped at 200 characters in length. If multiple debug statements are sent within one second, your messages are rate-limited to avoid crashing your browser.<br></p>

<div class="section-example-container">
    <pre class="csharp">Debug("My debug message");</pre>
    <pre class="python">self.Debug("My debug message")</pre>
</div>

<h4>Error</h4>
<p>Error statements are the same as log statements, but <code>Error</code> statements are displayed in red text in the Console. Use these statements when you want to give the most attention to a message in the Console. Error statements are rate-limited like debug statements.<br></p>

<div class="section-example-container">
    <pre class="csharp">Error("My error message");</pre>
    <pre class="python">self.Error("My error message")</pre>
</div>

<h4>Quit</h4>
<p>Quit statements cause your project to stop running and may log some data to the log file and Console. These statements are displayed in green text in the Console. The <code>Quit</code> statement does not work in the <code>Initialize</code> method. When you call this method, it proceeds to the end of the method definition. If you want to quit execution immediately, <code>return</code> after you call <code>Quit</code>.<br></p>

<div class="section-example-container">
    <pre class="csharp">Quit("My quit message");</pre>
    <pre class="python">self.Quit("My quit message")</pre>
</div>
