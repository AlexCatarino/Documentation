<p>Logging statements are statements that you can add to your algorithm in order to add information to the log file, add information to the <b>Console</b>, or even quit the program. Use them to debug your backtests and live algorithms. Consider adding them in the code block of an <code>if</code> statement to signify an error has been caught. <br></p>

<h4>Log</h4>
<p>Log statements are added to the log file while the program continues executing. Data vendor limitations prohibit price information from being added to log files. Use <code>Log</code> statements to debug your backtests and live trading algorithms. However, note that each organization has a limit on the number of log messages they can create. If your organization hits the daily limit, contact <a href="mailto:support@quantconnect.com">support@quantconnect.com</a>. Additionally, if multiple messages are sent with the same content, only the first message is added to the log file. Add a timestamp to your log messages to bypass the rate-limiting.<br></p>
<pre class="csharp">Log( (string) logMessage );</pre>
<pre class="python">self.Log( str( log_message ) )</pre>

<h4>Debug</h4>
<p>Debug statements are the same as log statements, but <code>Debug</code> statements are displayed in green text in the <b>Console</b>. Use them when you want to give more attention to a message in the <b>Console</b>. Debug messages are capped at 200 characters in length. If multiple debug statements are sent within one second, the messages are rate-limited to avoid crashing your browser.<br></p>
<pre class="csharp">Debug( (string) debugMessage );</pre>
<pre class="python">self.Debug( str( debug_message ) )</pre>

<h4>Error</h4>
<p>Error statements are the same as log statements, but <code>Error</code> statements are displayed in red text in the <b>Console</b>. Use them when you want to give the most attention to a message in the <b>Console</b>. Like debug statements, error statements are rate-limited.<br></p>
<pre class="csharp">Error( (string) errorMessage );</pre>
<pre class="python">self.Error( str( error_message ) )</pre>

<h4>Quit</h4>
<p>Quit statements cause the algorithm to stop running and may log some data to the log file and <b>Console</b>. They are displayed in green text in the <b>Console</b>. The <code>Quit</code> statement does not work in the <code>Initialize</code> method. When called, it proceeds to the end of the method definition. If you want to quit execution immediately, <code>return</code> after calling <code>Quit</code>.<br></p>
<pre class="csharp">Quit();</pre>
<pre class="python">self.Quit()</pre>
