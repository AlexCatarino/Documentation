<p>You can use the IDE charting capabilities to plot values over time when debugging. To add data points to a custom chart, call the <code>Plot</code> method with a chart name, series name, and value. Refer to the <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/tutorials'>Writing Algorithms tutorials</a> for a full example.</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
    <pre class="csharp">Plot(chart, series, value);</pre>
    <pre class="python">self.Plot(chart, series, value)</pre>
</div>


<p>We limit the number of points a chart can have to 4,000 because intensive charting generates hundreds of megabytes (200MB) of data, which is too much to stream online or display in a web browser. If you exceed the limit, the following error message is thrown:</p>

<span class='error-messages'>Exceeded maximum points per chart, data skipped</span>
