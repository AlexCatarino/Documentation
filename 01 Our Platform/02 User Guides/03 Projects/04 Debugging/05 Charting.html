<p>You can use the IDE charting capabilities to plot values over time when debugging. We limit the number of points a chart can have to 4,000 because intensive charting generates hundreds of megabytes (200MB) of data, which is too much to stream online or display in a web browser. If you exceed the limit, the <code>Exceeded maximum points per chart, data skipped </code>error is thrown.<br></p>
