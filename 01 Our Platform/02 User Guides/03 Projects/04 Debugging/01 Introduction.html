<p>Debugging is the process of systematically using a tool to find and fix errors in software. Errors can cause unintended trades, unexpected algorithm crashes, and faulty risk management logic. We use a debugging tool because we slow the code down, step through it line-by-line, and inspect the variables to understand the internal state of the program. To debug, you can use the built-in debugger, produce logging statements, and create charts.</p>
