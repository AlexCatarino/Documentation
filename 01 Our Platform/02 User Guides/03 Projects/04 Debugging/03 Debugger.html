<p>The debugger is a built-in tool to help you debug coding errors while backtesting. The debugger enables you to slow the code down, step through it line-by-line, and inspect the variables to understand the internal state of the program. The debugger accomplishes this by using breakpoints, watch variables, and stepping controls. Breakpoints are lines of code in your algorithm where execution will pause. Watch variables are the variables in your algorithm that you want to inspect during execution. The values of watch variables are formated in the IDE to improve readability. For example, when you watch a variable that references a DataFrame, the debugger represents the variable value as the following:</p>

<p>After you <a href="../../tutorials/backtesting/debugging">launch the debugger</a>, you can step through your algorithm with the following controls:<br></p>

<ul>
    <li><span class="ul-option">Play button</span>: Continue execution until the next breakpoint</li>
    <li><span class="ul-option">Stop button</span>: Exit the debugger</li>
    <li><span class="ul-option">Arrow button</span>: Step to the next line of code</li>
</ul>
