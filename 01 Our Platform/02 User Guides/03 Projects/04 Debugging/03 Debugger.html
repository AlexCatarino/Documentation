<p>The debugger is a built-in tool to help you debug coding errors when backtesting. The debugger lets you set breakpoints, observe watch variables, and step through your algorithm. Breakpoints are lines of code in your algorithm where execution will pause. Watch variables are the variables in your algorithm that you want to watch during execution. The values of watch variables are formated in the IDE to improve readability. For example, when watching a variable that references a DataFrame, the debugger may represent the variable value as the following:</p>

<img style="max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 15px; display: block" src="https://cdn.quantconnect.com/i/tu/debugger-dataframe.png">

<p>In addition to breakpoints and watch variables, you can step through your algorithm with the following controls:<br></p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Play button</b>: Continue execution until the next breakpoint</li>
    <li><b>Stop button</b>: Exit the debugger</li>
    <li><b>Arrow button</b>: Step to the next line of code</li>
</ul>
