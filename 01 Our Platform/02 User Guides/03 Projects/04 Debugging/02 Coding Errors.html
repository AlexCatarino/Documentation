<p>Coding errors are errors that cause the project to not build, throw exceptions, or behave unexpectedly. There are generally 3 types of coding errors: build, runtime, and logic errors. Each type of error occurs for different reasons, as outlined below.<br></p>
<h4>Build Errors</h4>
<p>Build errors occur when the interpreter's syntax check fails. An example code snippet that produces a build error is the following:</p>
<div class="section-example-container">
   <pre class="csharp">var a = 1;
if (a = 2) {}
    </pre>
   <pre class="python">a = 1
if a = 2:
    pass
    </pre>
</div>
<p>When build errors occur, you're notified in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
   <li>The number of build errors is displayed on the <b>Build</b> button.</li>
   <img style="padding-bottom: 15px" src="https://cdn.quantconnect.com/i/tu/build-error-build-button.png">
   <li>A red underline is applied to the line with the error.</li>
   <li>A warning message is added to the <b>Console.</b></li>
</ul>
<h4>Runtime Errors</h4>
<p>Runtime Errors, also called exceptions, occur when the interpreterâ€™s syntax checks pass but an error occurs during execution. An example code snippet that produces a runtime error is the following:<br></p>
<div class="section-example-container">
   <pre class="csharp">var a = new List<int>() {1};
var b = a[1];
    </int></pre>
   <pre class="python">a = [1]
a[1]
    </pre>
</div>
<p>When runtime errors occur, a stack trace of the error is added to the <b>Console</b> and the log file. For example, the snippet above produces the following error message:</p>
<div class="python" style="color: red; border: 2px solid grey; padding: 3px">
   Runtime Error: IndexError : list index out of range<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;at OnData<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a[1]<br>
   ===<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at Python.Runtime.PyObject.Invoke(PyTuple args in main.py: line 17<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Open Stacktrace)
</div>
<div class="csharp" style="color: red; border: 2px solid grey; padding: 3px">
   Runtime Error: Index was out of range. Must be non-negative and less than the size of the collection. (Parameter 'index') in Main.cs:line 24	 (Open Stacktrace)
</div>
<p>The stack trace from the build error identifies the line of code where the error occurs. If the error doesn't reference your project files, it's an issue with LEAN or another package.</p>
<h4>Logic Errors</h4>
<p>Logic errors occur when your algorithm behaves in an unexpected or unintended manner. These types of errors don't halt the program execution, so they are difficult to diagnose. An example code snippet that produces a logic error is the following:<br></p>
<div class="section-example-container">
   <pre class="csharp">var average = x + y / 2; // instead of (x + y) / 2
    </pre>
   <pre class="python">average = x + y / 2 # instead of (x + y) / 2
    </pre>
</div>
<p>To resolve logic errors, trace the program carefully. You may use the <code>Log</code> and <code>Debug</code> methods or the built-in debugger.</p>
