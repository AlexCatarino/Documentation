<p>Project collaboration enables multiple users within an organization to simultaneously work on the same project files. When collaborating on a project, youâ€™ll see the cursor of the other collaborators as they work on the project files. Team organizations can have 10 collaborators working on a project. Trading Firm and Insitution organizations can have an unlimited number of collaborators working on a project.</p>
