<p><a href="/docs/v2/our-platform/tutorials/projects/collaborating-on-projects#02-Add-Team-Members">Add team members to your project</a> to simultaneously work on the same code files together. When there are multiple people working on the same code file, the cursor of each member is visible in the IDE and all file changes occur in real-time for everyone. All of the team members that you add to a project have access to the project from their QuantConnect account. The number of members that you can add to a project depends on your <a href='/docs/v2/our-platform/user-guides/organizations/tier-features'>organization's tier</a>. The following table shows the number of collaborators each tier can have per project:<br></p>
