gplearn implements Genetic Programming in Python, with a scikit-learn inspired and compatible API. While Genetic Programming (GP) can be used to perform a very wide variety of tasks, gplearn is purposefully constrained to solving symbolic regression problems. This is motivated by the scikit-learn ethos, of having powerful estimators that are straight-forward to implement.<br>
