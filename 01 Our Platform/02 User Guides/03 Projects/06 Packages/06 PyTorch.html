PyTorch is a Python package that provides two high-level features: tensor computation (like NumPy) with strong GPU acceleration and deep neural networks built on a tape-based autograd system. You can reuse your favorite Python packages such as NumPy, SciPy, and Cython to extend PyTorch when needed. <br>
