<p>You can use many of the available open-source packages in your algorithms to complement the classes and methods you define yourself. Packages increase your development time because it's faster to use a pre-built, open-source package than to write the functionality. All packages are reviewed by our security team, and when approved, can be used in backtesting, live trading, and research. To use these packages, you need to add the relevant <code class="csharp">using</code><code class="python">import</code> statement at the top of your file. To promote efficiency, modules are only loaded once per interpreter session.</p>
