<p>Packages are third-party software repositories that you can use in your projects. You can use many of the available open-source packages to complement the classes and methods that you create. Packages reduce your development time because it's faster to use a pre-built, open-source package than to write the functionality. Packages can be used in backtesting, research, and live trading. To use these packages, add the relevant <code class="csharp">using</code><code class="python">import</code> statement at the top of your file.<br></p>
