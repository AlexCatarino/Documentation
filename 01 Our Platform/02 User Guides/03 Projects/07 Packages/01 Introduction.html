<p>Packages are third-party software repositories that you can use in your projects. You can use many of the available open-source packages to complement the classes and methods that you create. Packages increase your development time because it's faster to use a pre-built, open-source package than to write the functionality. All packages are reviewed by our security team. When we approve packages, they can be used in backtesting, research, and live trading. To use these packages, add the relevant <code class="csharp">using</code><code class="python">import</code> statement at the top of your file. To promote efficiency, modules are only loaded once per interpreter session.</p>
