<p>You can use many of the available open-source packages in your algorithms to complement the classes and methods that you define. Packages increase your development time because it's faster to use a pre-built, open-source package than to write the functionality. All packages are reviewed by our security team. When the packages are approved, they can be used in backtesting, live trading, and research. To use these packages, add the relevant <code class="csharp">using</code><code class="python">import</code> statement at the top of your file. To promote efficiency, modules are only loaded once per interpreter session.</p>
