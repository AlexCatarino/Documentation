<p>To request a new package, contact <a href="mailto:support@quantconnect.com">support@quantconnect.com</a>. We will add the package to the queue for review and deployment. Since the packages run on our servers, we need to ensure they are secure and won't cause harm. The process of adding new packages takes 2-4 weeks to complete. View the list of packages under review on the <a href='https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Alibrary-request'>Issues list of the LEAN GitHub repository</a>.</p>
