<p>
    This group of charts shows the behaviors of both your strategy and the benchmark during certain historical periods.
    We set the value of your strategy the same as the benchmark at the beginning of each crisis event, and the lines represent the cumulative returns of your strategy and benchmark from the beginning of the crisis event.
    The report only contains the crisis event charts whose periods are covered by your strategy.
