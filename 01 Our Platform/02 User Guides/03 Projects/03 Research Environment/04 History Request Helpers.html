<p>The Research Environment has history request helpers that are not available in backtesting and live trading. The history request helpers work with the following data:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Fundamental data</li>
    <li>Option contract data</li>
    <li>Future contract data</li>
</ul>

<p>You can access historical data on the above datasets from the Research Environment so that you can analyze the data before backtesting a strategy that uses the data in an event-driven manner.</p>
