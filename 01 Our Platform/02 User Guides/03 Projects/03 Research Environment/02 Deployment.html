<p>You need an idle research node in your organization to launch the Research Environment. When you launch the Research Environment, a Jupyter notebook opens where you can use our data, the <code>QuantBook</code> class, the QuantConnect API, and the Alpha Streams SDK. The best-performing research node is automatically selected when you launch the Research Environment, but you have the option to manually select a node.</p>
