<p>Look-ahead bias occurs when an algorithm makes decisions using data that would not have yet been available. A simple example of look-ahead bias is using the closing price to make trading decisions and filling your orders at the same closing price. This can happen in the Research Environment because all of the data is available at the same time. However, this type of look-ahead bias cannot occur when backtesting with Lean because the data is fed into your algorithm in discrete slices of time and an order is filled using a slice that occurs after the order was placed.</p>

<p>A second example of look-ahead bias occurs when researchers test a model on the same dataset that was used to train the model. In this situation, the model is trained using data that would not have been available when the model was created in practice. A third example of look-ahead bias is when researchers select a universe to apply their trading strategy to based on the past performance of the universe.</p>
