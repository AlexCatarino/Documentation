<p>The Research Environment is a <a href="https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/notebook.html">Jupyter notebook</a>-based environment where you can access our data through the <code>QuantBook</code> class instead of using the <code>QCAlgorithm</code> class in a backtest. The environment supports both Python and C#. To aid development, you can import code from the code files in your project into the Research Environment.</p>

<p>Before running backtests, we recommend testing your hypothesis in the Research Environment. It's easier to perform data analysis and produce plots in the Research Environment than in a backtest. In the Research Environment, you can use the QuantConnect API to import your backtest results for further analysis. You can also access Alpha Analytics without downloading anything to your local machine. Before backtesting or live trading machine learning models, you may find it beneficial to train them in the Research Environment, save them in the ObjectStore, and then load them from the ObjectStore into the backtesting and live trading environment before you run the backtest or deploy to live trading.</p>
