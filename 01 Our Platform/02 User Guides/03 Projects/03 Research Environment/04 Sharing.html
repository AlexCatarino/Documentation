<p>Sharing your notebooks is helpful when publishing your findings online, getting feedback on your research process, and explaining your methodology to others. There are several ways that you can share a research notebook with others:</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="../../tutorials/organizations/managing-team-members#03-Add-Members">Add a team member to the project</a>. They will be able to view the notebook but the Research Environment does not currently support collaboration.</li>
    <li><a href="../../tutorials/backtesting/managing-backtests#03-Run-Backtests">Run a backtest</a>, <a href="../../tutorials/backtesting/managing-backtests#09-Share-Backtests">generate a link to share the backtest</a>, and then give the backtest link to the other person. They will be able to clone the project and launch the Research Environment using the notebook files.</li>
    <li>Download the notebook and then share the downloaded file with the other person. You can download notebooks in various file formats (<span class="public-file-name">.html</span>, <span class="public-file-name">.pdf</span>, <span class="public-file-name">.ipynb</span>, etc) but the Research Environment does not support uploading <span class="public-file-name">.ipynb</span> files.</li>
</ul>
