<p>Sharing your notebooks is helpful when you want to accomplish any of the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Publish your findings online or in the community forum</li>
    <li>Get feedback on your research process</li>
    <li>Explain your methodology to others</li>
    <li>Report data issues</li>
</ul>

<p>There are several ways that you can share a research notebook with others:</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="../../tutorials/organizations/managing-team-members#03-Add-Members">Add a team member to the project</a>. They will be able to view the notebook but the Research Environment does not currently support collaboration.</li>
    <li><a href="../../tutorials/backtesting/managing-backtests#03-Run-Backtests">Run a backtest</a>, <a href="../../tutorials/backtesting/managing-backtests#09-Share-Backtests">generate a link to share the backtest</a>, and then give the backtest link to the other person. They will be able to clone the project and launch the Research Environment using the notebook files.</li>
    <li>Download the notebook and then share the downloaded file with the other person. You can download notebooks in various file formats (<b>.html</b>, <b>.pdf</b>, <b>.ipynb</b>, etc) but the Research Environment does not support uploading <b>.ipynb</b> files.</li>
</ul>
