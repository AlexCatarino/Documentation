<p>You need an idle research node in your organization to launch the Research Environment. When you launch the Research Environment, a Jupyter notebook opens where you can use:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Datasets</li>
    <li>The <code>QuantBook</code> class</li>
    <li>QuantConnect API</li>
    <li>Alpha Streams SDK</li>
</ul>

<p>The best-performing research node is automatically selected when you launch the Research Environment. Select specific nodes in the Algorithm Lab.</p>
