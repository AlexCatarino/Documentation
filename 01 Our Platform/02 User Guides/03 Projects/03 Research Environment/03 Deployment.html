<p>You need an idle research node in your organization to launch the Research Environment. The Research Environment is a Jupyter notebook that provides cloud access the following products:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Datasets</li>
    <li>The <code>QuantBook</code> class</li>
    <li>QuantConnect API</li>
    <li>Alpha Streams SDK</li>
</ul>

<p>As you launch the Research Environment, the IDE automatically selects the best research node that's available in your organization. Select specific nodes in the Algorithm Lab.</p>
