<p>There are several ways you can share a research notebook with others. First, you can share the project that contains your research notebook with a member of your organization. When you share the project with other members, they can view the notebook but collaboration on notebooks is not currently supported. Second, you can run a backtest, generate a link to share the backtest, and give the backtest link to others to give them a copy of the notebook. Third, you can download the notebook in various file formats (<b>.html</b>, <b>.pdf</b>, <b>.ipynb</b>, etc) and share the downloaded file. Although, uploading <b>.ipynb</b> files is not currently supported.</p>
