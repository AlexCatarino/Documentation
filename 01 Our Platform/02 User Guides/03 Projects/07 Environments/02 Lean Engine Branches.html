<p>Custom Lean engine branches give you access to <a href='https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean/branches'>custom versions of Lean</a> in the QuantConnect web IDE to run backtests, launch research notebooks, and deploy live trading strategies. The custom versions include historical master branches of Lean and other feature branches. If you are in an organization on the Trading Firm or Institution tier, you can <a href='/docs/v2/our-platform/tutorials/projects/selecting-environments#02-Change-LEAN-Engine-Branches'>change the Lean engine branch</a> from the Algorithm Lab. These branches are created by making pull requests, which are reviewed by the Lean team.</p>
