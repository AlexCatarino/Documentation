<p>Intellisense is a GUI tool in your code files that shows auto-completion options and presents the members that are accessible from the current object. It works by a search algorithm attempting to find the correct statement you're looking for, given the context. You can use Intellisense to auto-complete method names and object attributes. When you use it, a pop-up displays in the IDE with the following information:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Member type</li>
    <li>Member description</li>
    <li>The parameters that the method accepts (if the member is a method)</li>
</ul>

<p>Use Intellisense to speed up your algorithm development. It works with all of the default class members in LEAN, but it doesn't currently support class names or user-defined objects. If you don't want to use it in our cloud IDE, local auto-complete is also available for <a href="../../../lean-cli/tutorials/local-autocomplete">select IDEs</a>.</p>
