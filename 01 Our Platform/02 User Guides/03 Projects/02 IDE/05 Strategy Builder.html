<p>The Strategy Builder is a convenient tool to include individual algorithm framework modules in a new project. Each of the modules in the Strategy Builder contains a description and list of the pre-selected settings for the module. After selecting components and exiting the Strategy Builder, the code to add the components to the project is automatically generated for you. Once the modules are added to your project, you can adjust the arguments passed to the modules for further customization. By using the Strategy Builder, you can run backtests and deploy live trading algorithms without writing any code.</p>
