<p>The Strategy Builder is a convenient tool to include individual algorithm framework modules in a new project without writing any code. Each of the modules in the Strategy Builder contains a description and list of the pre-selected settings for the module. After selecting modules and exiting the Strategy Builder, the code to add the modules to the project is automatically generated for you. The modules you selected are accessible in your code files, but the class definitions of the modules aren't injected into your project files. Instead, they are available in the LEAN GitHub repository. After you've added modules to your project, you can adjust the arguments passed to the modules for further customization.</p>

<p>The Strategy Builder streamlines your development process. It's an easy way to get familiar with using the API to create trading strategies without writing any code. The number of framework components available in the Strategy Build is an ever-growing list, so it improves over time. If you don't want to use the Strategy builder, you can disable it so that it doesn't display when you create new projects.</p>
