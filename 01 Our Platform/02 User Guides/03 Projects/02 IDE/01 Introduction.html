<p>Many features are built into the web IDE to make project development easier. You can use the Strategy Builder to select framework modules for a new project and have the code automatically generated. Projects can be cloned within an organization, migrated out of an organization, and shared with anyone on the internet. Algorithm parameters enable you to extract hard-coded values from your algorithm and perform parameter optimization. LEAN engine branches give you access to custom versions of LEAN in the QuantConnect web IDE.</p>
