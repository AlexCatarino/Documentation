<p>The LEAN engine supports C# and Python. The engine is written in C#, so it is the native language. However, Python is supported using Python.NET. In terms of comparing the languages, C# is faster than Python and it's easier to contribute to LEAN if you have features written in C# modules. Python is less verbose, has more third-party packages, and is more popular among the QuantConnect community than C#. Python is also the native language for the research notebooks, so it's easier to use when performing research.</p>
