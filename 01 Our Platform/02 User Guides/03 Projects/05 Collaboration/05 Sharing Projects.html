<p><a href="../../tutorials/backtesting/managing-backtests#03-Run-Backtests">Run a backtest</a> and then <a href="../../tutorials/backtesting/managing-backtests#09-Share-Backtests">make the backtest results public</a> to share a project. Once a backtest is made public, a link is generated for you that opens the backtest results and the project files. You can directly give the link to others, attach the backtest to a forum discussion, or embed the backtest into a website. However, note that when you make a backtest public, the project files are accessible to anyone who visits the link, even after you delete the project. As a result, we do not recommend collaborating on projects by making backtests public and sharing the link with the people with which you are collaborating. Instead, we recommend <a href="#02-Adding-Team-Members">adding team members to your project</a> since doing so protects your intellectual property.</p>

<p>You can share a backtest at any time when it's executing. Although, if you generate a link to share the backtest before the backtest completes, the link that's generated will not contain all of the backtest results. Some reasons to share your project include the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Attach the project to the forum to ask for help, gather feedback, or report an issue.</li>
    <li>Attach the project to a data issue to reduce the amount of time it takes to fix the data issue.</li>
    <li>Share a link to the project with others to give them a copy of the project files and the backtest results.</li>
</ul>
