<p>Add team members to your project to simultaneously work on the same code files together. When there are multiple people working on the same code file, the cursor of each member is visible in the IDE and all file changes occur in real-time for everyone. All of the team members that are added to the project have access to the project in their QuantConnect project files. The number of members that can work together on the same project is limited by their organization tier. The limits of each tier are:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Team</b>: 10</li>
    <li><b>Trading Firm</b>: Unlimited</li>
    <li><b>Institution</b>: Unlimited</li>
</ul>
