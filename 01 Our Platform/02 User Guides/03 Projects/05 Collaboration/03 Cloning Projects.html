<p>Clone a project to create a new copy of the project and save it within the same organization. When you clone a project, the project files are duplicated but the backtest results and the content stored in the ObjectStore is not retained. Cloning is helpful when making changes to a file before merging the changes back into the original project. Cloning is also a fast way to delete ObjectStore storage while keeping the project files. You can clone the project and then delete the original version of the project.</p>
