<p>Clone a project to create a new copy of the project and save it within the same organization. When you clone a project, the project files are duplicated but the backtest results and the content stored in the ObjectStore is not retained. Cloning enables you to test small changes in your projects before merging the changes back into the original project. Cloning also enables you to clear ObjectStore storage while keeping the project files. You can just clone the project and then delete the original version of the project.</p>
