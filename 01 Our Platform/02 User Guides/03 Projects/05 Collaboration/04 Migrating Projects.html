<p>Migrate a project to clone the project and move the cloned version of the project from an organization you own to another organization of which you're a member. Migrating a project enables you to run the project using resources from another organization and to collaborate on the project with members from a different organization. Only the organization administrator can migrate projects out of the organization. When you migrate a project, the project files are copied but the content stored in the ObjectStore is not retained. </p>
