<p>Projects contains code files (<b>.py</b> or <b>.cs</b>) and notebook files (<b>.ipynb</b>). Run backtests with code files and launch the Research Environment with notebook files. Code files and notebook files can import code from other code files. However, notebook files use individual research nodes, so they can't import code from other notebook files. You can <a href="../../tutorials/projects/managing-files">rename, move, and delete files</a> in the web IDE to aid navigation. When you <a href='../../tutorials/backtesting/managing-backtests#03-Run-Backtests'>run backtests</a>, your project's code files must subclass the <code>QCAlgorithm</code> class so that you can plug into the Lean engine and execute the backtest.</p>
