<p>Projects contains code files (<b>.py</b> or <b>.cs</b>) and notebook files (<b>.ipynb</b>). Code files enable you to run backtests while notebook files enable you to launch the Research Environment. Code files and notebook files can import code from other code files. However, notebook files use individual research nodes, so they can't import code from other notebook files. You can rename, move, and delete files in the web IDE to aid navigation. When running backtests, the project files should subclass the <code>QCAlgorithm</code> class so that you can plug into the LEAN engine to execute the backtests.</p>
