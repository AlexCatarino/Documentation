<!--
<p>QuantConnect projects contain code files, research notebooks, and directories. The code files contain the Python or C# codes that define a subclass of the QCAlgorithm class. Creating a subclass of the QCAlgorithm class allows you to plug into the LEAN engine to run backtests. The research notebook files are used for accessing the Research environment. The directories can be used to organize the code files and notebook files for easier project navigation.</p>
