<p>Algorithm parameters are hard-coded values for variables in your project that are set outside of the project files. The parameters values are sent to the algorithm when on deployment so it's not possible to change the values while the algorithm is running. To get the parameter value into your algorithm, use the <code>GetParameter</code> method. Alternatively, in C# projects, you can apply the <code>Parameter</code> attribute to define public class members with algorithm parameter values. By adding algorithm parameters to your project, you remove hard-coded values from your code files and you unlock the ability to perform parameter optimization.</p>
