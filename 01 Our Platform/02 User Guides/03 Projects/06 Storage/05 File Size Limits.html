<p>Code files can contain up to 64,000 characters. The file size limits are in place to encourage members to split up their files into modular components. If you have files with more than 64,000 characters, separate the content into multiple files. Alternatively, if the file contains data instead of code, you can import the data from a custom data source or read the data from the ObjectStore.</p>

<p>Notebook files can be up to 128KB in size. They won't save if their size exceeds the limit. If your notebook file exceeds the limit, move the code in the notebook to a code file and then import the code file into the notebook. Alternatively, like code files, if the file contains data instead of code, you can import the data from a custom data source or read the data from the ObjectStore.</p>
