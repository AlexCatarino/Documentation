<p>All organizations get 500MB of free storage in the ObjectStore. Not every organization needs storage space, but organizations on the Team tier or higher have the ability to subscribe to more storage space. We have a limited amount of hardware for storage use, so the following storage options are available:</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>500MB</b>: Free</li>
    <li><b>1GB</b>: $10/month</li>
    <li><b>2GB</b>: $20/month</li>
    <li><b>5GB</b>: $50/month</li>
    <li><b>10GB</b>: $100/month</li>
</ul>

<p>You can see how much ObjectStore storage your organization has used from the organization's <strong>Resources</strong> page in the Algorithm Lab. The usage reports list the total usage in the organization and the usage of individual projects within the organization so that you can easily manage your storage space.</p>
