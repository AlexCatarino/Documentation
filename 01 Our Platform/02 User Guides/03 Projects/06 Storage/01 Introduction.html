<p>The projects of your organizations are stored on our cloud servers and are accessible with your account. The ObjectStore is a project-specific key-value storage location to save and retrieve strings and bytes. Some common use cases of the ObjectStore include the following:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Saving algorithm variable values between deployments</li>
    <li>Transporting data between the backtesting environment and the research environment</li>
    <li>Training machine learning models in the research environment before deploying them to live trading</li>
</ul>
