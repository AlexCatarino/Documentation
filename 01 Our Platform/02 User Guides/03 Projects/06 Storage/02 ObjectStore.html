<p>The ObjectStore is a project-specific key-value storage location to save and retrieve data. All organizations get 500MB of free storage in the ObjectStore. Not every organization needs storage space, but organizations on the Team tier or higher can <a href='../../tutorials/organizations/handling-resources#08-Edit-ObjectStore-Limits'>subscribe to more storage space</a>. We provide the following storage options:</p>

<ul>
    <li><span class='ul-option'>500MB</span>: Free</li>
    <li><span class='ul-option'>1GB</span>: $10/month</li>
    <li><span class='ul-option'>2GB</span>: $20/month</li>
    <li><span class='ul-option'>5GB</span>: $50/month</li>
    <li><span class='ul-option'>10GB</span>: $100/month</li>
</ul>

<p>You can see how much ObjectStore storage your organization has used from the organization's Resources page in the Algorithm Lab. The usage reports list the total usage in the organization and the usage of individual projects within the organization so that you can easily <a href='../../tutorials/organizations/handling-resources#09-Delete-ObjectStore-Storage'>manage your storage space</a>.</p>
