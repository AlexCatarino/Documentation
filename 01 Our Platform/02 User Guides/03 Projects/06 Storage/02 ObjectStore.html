<p>All organizations get 500MB of free storage in the ObjectStore. Not every organization needs storage space, but organizations on the Team tier or higher can <a href='../../tutorials/organizations/handling-resources#08-Edit-ObjectStore-Limits'>subscribe to more storage space</a>. We have a limited amount of hardware for storage use, so the following storage options are available:</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>500MB</b>: Free</li>
    <li><b>1GB</b>: $10/month</li>
    <li><b>2GB</b>: $20/month</li>
    <li><b>5GB</b>: $50/month</li>
    <li><b>10GB</b>: $100/month</li>
</ul>

<p>You can see how much ObjectStore storage your organization has used from the organization's <strong>Resources</strong> page in the Algorithm Lab. The usage reports list the total usage in the organization and the usage of individual projects within the organization so that you can easily <a href='../../tutorials/organizations/handling-resources#09-Delete-ObjectStore-Storage'>manage your storage space</a>.</p>
