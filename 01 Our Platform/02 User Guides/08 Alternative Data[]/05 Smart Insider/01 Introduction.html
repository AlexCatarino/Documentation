QuantConnect hosts company buyback intentions and transaction data provided by <a href="https://www.smartinsider.com" target="_BLANK">Smart Insider</a>. A "buy-back" is when a company repurchases its own stock. It reduces the number of shares available to other investors, which in theory should reduce the supply of shares and increase the stock price.

    Smart Insider has two data sets available to use in your algorithm. The <i>Intentions</i> data set is an announcement that establishes the intention to buy-back shares of the company. 
When the buy-back occurs this triggers a <i>Transaction</i> event with details about the execution of the buyback. <i>Intention</i> events always come before the <i>Transaction</i> event.
