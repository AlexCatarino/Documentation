<p>Our platform supports using machine learning techniques in your trading strategies. The ObjectStore provides a place for storing and retrieving machine learning models. By using the ObjectStore, you can train models in the research environment before loading them into the backtesting and live trading environment. Additionally, you can store models in the ObjectStore to save you from having to retrain the model between backtests and live deployments.</p>

<h4>Saving and loading models with pickle</h4>
<p>Most machine learning models can be saved to the ObjectStore by serializing the model with pickle and then using the <code>SaveBytes</code> method. Loading the model is then done by retrieving the bytes from the ObjectStore with <code>ReadBytes</code>, converting the bytes into a bytearray, and then loading the model with pickle. The snippet below demonstrates the process of saving and loading models with pickle serialization. For a full example, refer to <a href="https://www.quantconnect.com/terminal/processCache?request=embedded_backtest_2ab685042befba991ec08b115ea08115.html">this notebook</a>.</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="python">import pickle

# Save the model
self.ObjectStore.SaveBytes('model_key', pickle.dumps(model))

# Load the model
model_bytes = self.ObjectStore.ReadBytes('model_key')
model = pickle.loads(bytearray(model_bytes))
</pre>
</div>

<h4>Saving and loading keras models</h4>
<p>To save a keras model to the ObjectStore, use the <code>serialize_keras_object</code> method from the <code>keras.util</code> library to convert the model into a JSON object. The <code>json.dumps</code> method can then convert the JSON object into a string that can be saved in the ObjectStore. Once saved, Keras models can be loaded from the ObjectStore and reconstructed by using the <code>json.loads</code> and <code>Sequential.from_config</code> methods. The snippet below demonstrates the process of saving and loading keras models. For a full example, refer to <a href="https://www.quantconnect.com/terminal/processCache?request=embedded_backtest_4919fad00e933f16119983213614646d.html">this research notebook</a>.</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="python">import json
from keras.utils.generic_utils import serialize_keras_object

# Saving the model
model_str = json.dumps(serialize_keras_object(model))
self.ObjectStore.Save('model_key', model_str)

# Loading the model
model_str = qb.ObjectStore.Read('model_key')
config = json.loads(model_str)['config']
model = Sequential.from_config(config)
</pre>
</div>
