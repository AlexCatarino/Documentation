<p>If you save your projects to your QC account, storage limits are imposed on your project. The ObjectStore is a location to store data between backtests. The ObjectStore can store the following data types:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Regular strings</li>
    <li>Bytes</li>
    <li>JSON objects</li>
    <li>XML strings</li>
</ul>

<p>The ObjectStore can hold 500MB of data, but itâ€™s extendable in organizations with multiple people.</p>
