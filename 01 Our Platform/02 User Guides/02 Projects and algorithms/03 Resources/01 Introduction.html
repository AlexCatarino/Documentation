<!-- Duplicate of Organization>Resources -->
<p>Resources include hardware nodes, ObjectStore storage, and QuantConnect Credits (QCC). Hardware nodes include nodes for backtesting, research, and live trading. The ObjectStore storage is used to store data between backtests and during live trading. QCC is used to run parameter optimizations and access datasets. QCC can also be applied to your invoices monthly as a discount or given to other community members as a tip. To promote efficiency, all of the resources within an organization are shared among the organization members.</p>
