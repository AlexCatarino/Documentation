What is the compensation<br>- The price of the alpha is determined either by the minimum price or market force (if capacity is filled)<br>- 100% of the price goes to the author, an additional 30% on top of your price is paid to QC by the investor.<br>- Payments are held for 1-month (? -- ask jared)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - They may be paid at the end of the month (?)<br><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - If there is a bug in the alpha, we contact the author first. If they don’t address in time, the investor may want to cancel. We use these held funds to process refunds</div><div>- Payments are collected into your QC Wallet as Marketplace Earnings. You can convert them to QCC or withdraw.<br></div><br><br>What’s my alpha worth?<br>- Maximum earnings at debut = capacity / allocation_lot_size * market_price (if price doesn’t change from the reserve price)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Meaning: You can make more if the alpha has a high capacity or the market_price goes up<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - High capacity =&gt; You can have a lot of investors<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Low capacity =&gt; If capacity is filled and price moves up, the price may be too high for new investors<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Give an example<div>
