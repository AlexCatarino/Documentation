<p>The <b>Asset Allocation</b> plot displays a time-weighted average of the absolute holdings value for each asset that entered the Alpha's portfolio during the backtest and live trading periods. When an asset has a percentage that is too small to be shown in the pie chart, it is incorporated into an "Others" category.</p>
