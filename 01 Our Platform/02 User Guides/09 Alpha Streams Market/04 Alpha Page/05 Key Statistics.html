<p>The <b>Key Statistics</b> section displays the following metrics of the Alpha's performance:</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Days Live</b>: The number of days the algorithm has been live on QuantConnect.</li>
    <li><b>Live Sharpe Ratio</b>:  The Sharpe Ratio of the Alpha's live performance.</li>
    <li><b>Return Correlation</b>: The correlation of daily returns between the live and <a href='../live-trading/reconciliation'>out-of-sample backtest</a> periods.</li>
    <li><b>Dynamic Time Warp</b>: The Dynamic Time Warp between the live and <a href='../live-trading/reconciliation'>out-of-sample backtest</a> periods.</li>
    <li><b>Probabilistic SR</b>: The <a href="../optimization/objectives#05-PSR">Probabilistic Sharpe Ratio</a> of the Alpha's backtest and live performance.</li>
    <li><b>Market</b>: The asset classes that the Alpha trades.</li>
    <li><b>Drawdown</b>: The largest peak to trough decline in the Alpha's equity curve during the backtest and live trading periods.</li>
    <li><b>CAGR</b>: The <a href="../optimization/objectives#02-CAGR">cumulative annual growth rate</a> of the Alpha during the backtest and live trading periods.</li>
    <li><b>Turnover</b>: The percentage of the Alpha's portfolio that has been replaced in a given year.</li>
    <li><b>Score</b>: The score is calculated as</li>
    <img style="max-width:100%; display:block; max-height: 75px" src="https://cdn.quantconnect.com/i/tu/score-formula.png">
    <p>A higher score represents a high-performing, realistic algorithm.</p>
    <li><b>Information Ratio</b>: The information Ratio of the Alpha's backtest and live performance.</li>
    <li><b>Trades per Day</b>: The total number of trades during the Alpha's live trading period divided by the number of days the algorithm has been live on QuantConnect. Trades per day is an approximation of the Alpha's trading frequency.</li>
    <li><b>Capital Requirement</b>: The minimum amount of capital that you need to deploy the Alpha with real money. If you license less than the capital requirement, you can only deploy the Alpha with a paper trading account.</li>
</ul>
