<p>Algorithms can only be listed in the Alpha Stream Market if they are backtested using the most recent 5-7 years of historical data and achieve the following backtest results:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The algorithm must be profitable.</li>
    <li>Capacity &gt;= $250,000.</li>
    <li>Probabilistic Sharpe ratio &gt; 80%.</li>
    <li>Maximum drawdown &lt;= 20%.</li>
    <li>If the maximum drawdown is 10% or more, then the equity of the algorithm must make a new all-time high within 6 months.</li>
    <li>A trade must be placed on the first trading day.</li>
</ul>

<p>Alphas can not use custom data sources, but they can use most of the datasets listed in our Dataset Market. Refer to the <b>License</b> tab on a dataset listing to see if the dataset is eligible for use in Alpha Streams.</p>

<p>Alphas do not need to perform well in all market environments to be accepted into the Alpha Streams Market. Licenses can adjust their allocation to the Alphas over time.</p> 

<p>Alphas must be grounded in reality and authors can not have multiple Alphas in the market that are too correlated with each other. Rejecting Alphas that are closely correlated and developed by the same author helps investors avoid licensing slightly different versions of the same Alphas.</p>

<p>If an algorithm is accepted to the Alpha Streams Market, it is immediately listed in the market. If an algorithm does not meet the admission requirements above, the algorithm is rejected and our Alpha Streams team provides comments on why the algorithm was rejected. When an algorithm is rejected, the author can update the algorithm and then submit the updated version for review.</p>

<p>In our Alpha submission process, we ask authors to include information on themselves and meta information about the algorithm. The information that's collected is displayed on the Alpha listing for investors to review. The following Alpha information is collected with each submission:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Name</li>
    <li>Description</li>
    <li>Reserve price</li>
    <li>Image</li>
    <li>Type of universe selection</li>
    <li>Type of alpha generation</li>
    <li>Type of portfolio construction</li>
    <li>Type of risk control</li>
    <li>Type of execution model(s)</li>
</ul>

<p>The Alpha author's biography, work experience, and education is recorded to create the Alpha listing page.</p>
