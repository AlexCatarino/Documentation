<p>An Alpha is an algorithm written by a QuantConnect member that investors can subscribe to in order to be notified of live changes in the Alpha's holdings. The member who researches and develops the algorithm is the Alpha author and the investor or fund that licenses the algorithm is the licensee. The Alpha life cycle is the process that an Alpha undertakes to go from discovery to live trading to delisting.</p>
