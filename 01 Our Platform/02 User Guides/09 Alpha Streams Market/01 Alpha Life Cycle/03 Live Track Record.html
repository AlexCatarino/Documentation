<p>We deploy the Alphas that are accepted into the Alpha Streams Market to paper trading in order to produce the live trading results on the <a href="alpha-listings">Alpha listing</a> page. The live trading results are simulated using the <code>AlphaStreamsBrokerageModel</code>, so you may experience slightly different results when you deploy the Alpha using a real brokerage. We do not allocate capital to Alphas without licensing the Alpha and paying the author.</p>
