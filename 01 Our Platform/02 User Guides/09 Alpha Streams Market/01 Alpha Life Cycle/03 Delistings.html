What are delistings:<br>-When an alpha is removed from the marketplace<br>-If an algorithm does not meet the live performance requirements, it’s delisted<br><br>What would cause an alpha to be delisted:<br>-3 month grace period<br>-https://www.quantconnect.com/docs/key-concepts/reconciliation#Reconciliation-Scoring-Reconciliation <br>-&lt;40% DTW&nbsp; or&nbsp; return correlation &gt; .5&nbsp; or&nbsp; Live sharpe &gt; -3<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - DTW of 0 is the returns are the same between backtesting and live<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Return correlation should be as close to 1 as possible<br>-Logic error and the author doesn’t fix it<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - We need to temporarily hide the alpha from the marketplace if the author doesn’t fix the error quickly<br>-Run-time errors and the author doesn’t fix it<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - QuantConnect contacts alpha authors to help them fix run-time errors to keep the alpha in the market<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - if there is an error in the code and the author doesn’t address it (like SetHoldings in a crypto algorithm), QC will try contacting the author<br><br>What if people are invested in an alpha that passes the delisting metrics:<br>-If there are people invested in the alphas, we won’t delist it, but we can talk to the investors.<div>
