<p>Alphas can be removed from the Alpha Streams Market after their 3 month grace period if any of the following circumstances occur:</p>

<ul>

    <li><a href="../live-trading/reconciliation">Return correlation</a> &lt; .5</li>
    <li>Sharpe ratio &lt; -3</li>
    <li>A logic error occurred and the author doesn't fix it</li>
    <p>In this case, we will temporarily hide the Alpha from the market until the author fixes the error.</p>
    <li>A runtime error occurred at the author doesn't fix it</li>
    <p>In this case, we contact the author to help them fix the runtime error so that they can keep the Alpha listed in the market.</p>
</ul>

<p>If licensees are invested in an Alpha that passes the metrics above to be delisted, we contact the licensees instead of immediately delisting the Alpha.</p>
