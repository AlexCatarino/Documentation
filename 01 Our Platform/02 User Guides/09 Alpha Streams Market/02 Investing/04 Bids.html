<p>Bids are offers from investors to license Alpha allocations at a specific price for a period of time. The minimum bid price is $3/allocation but authors can set a custom reserve price that investors must bid to be granted an allocation. When investors place their bids, they can choose to license the Alphas for a period of 1-3 months. Bids work like the same a buy limit orders when trading securities. Investors can create and cancel bids at any time. If an Alpha has lots available when you place a bid, the bid is automatically accepted. If there are no lots available, the bid will stay on the Alpha order book until it is filled. Standing bids can be filled when investors unsubscribe from an Alpha or when an auction occurs. Bids automatically renew. Therefore, if you don't want to renew your Alpha subscription, you must cancel your bid.<br></p><div>What are bids:<br></div><div>- An offer from an investor to license alpha allocations at a specific price for a period of time (1-3 months)<br></div><div><br></div><div>Why are there bids:</div><div>- To match supply and demand<br></div><div>- Bids work like limit buy orders when trading securities.&nbsp;<br></div><div>- Bids can be placed and canceled at any time</div><div>- If your bid expires or you are outbid in an auction, you lose your allocation</div><div>- Bids auto-renew, so you need to cancel your bid if you donâ€™t want to renew at the next auction</div><div><br></div><div>What is the relationship between bid price and capacity?</div><div>- The minimum price is $3 for a bid, but the price adjusts with market forces after the capacity of the alpha is consumed</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp; - More buyers =&gt; price increases; Fewer buyers =&gt; price decreases</div><div>- If there is capacity remaining in an alpha, bids are instantly accepted.
