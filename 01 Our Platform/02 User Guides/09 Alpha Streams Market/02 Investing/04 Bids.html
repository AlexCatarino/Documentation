<p>Bids are offers from investors to license Alpha allocations at a specific price for a period of 1-3 months. The default minimum bid price is $3/allocation but authors can set a custom reserve price that you must bid to be granted an allocation. Bids work the same as buy limit orders when trading securities. You can create and cancel bids at any time. If an Alpha has lots available when you place your bid, your bid is automatically accepted. If there are no lots available when you place your bid, your bid stays on the Alpha order book until you are granted a subscription or you cancel your bid. Your bids can be filled immediately or when the monthly auction occurs. Your bids automatically renew, but you can cancel them at any time.</p>
