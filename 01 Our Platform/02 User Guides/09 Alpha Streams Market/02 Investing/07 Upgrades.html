<p>The author of an Alpha may occasionally update the Alpha code to fix bugs, adjust parameters, or add new logic. We have a thorough review process to ensure the updates do not drastically change the core concept of the Alpha. As a license holder, you always have the right to deploy the latest version of the Alpha. You can continue to run the old version of the Alpha, but we recommend stopping the deployment of the old version and then deploying the new version.</p>
