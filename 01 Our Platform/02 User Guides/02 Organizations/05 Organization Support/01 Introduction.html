The community is a great resource for support on developing algorithms. However, you can also subscribe to professional support from a member of quantconnect. Members in your organization need a support seat to submit a support ticket. There are three tiers of support seats available with various levels of support. You can add support seats available in the Support tab in the Algorithm Lab.
