QuantConnect is built around organizations. A default personal organization is created for every account, but you can also create new organizations or join existing ones.  Multiple users can belong to an organization, and share resources for backtesting and live trading. Organizations aim to give individuals and businesses the power to scale their quantitative trading on QuantConnect.

Organizations using QuantConnect have the ability to subscribe to more resources as needed. Many of the free features previously available for individual accounts are still available, however, the payment structure for additional resources have been updated to accommodate growth by organizations. As you grow on QuantConnect, you may need more live nodes to run more live algorithms and more backtesting nodes for faster concurrent backtesting with a simple monthly subscription.
