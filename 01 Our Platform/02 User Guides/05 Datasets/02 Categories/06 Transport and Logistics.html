<p>Transport and logistics data is data that's collected on the transportation of goods and the logistics that make the transportation happen. This data category includes US Federal Reserve data, supply chain data, and air travel data. US Federal Reserve data enables you to trade on macroeconomic factors and the flow of bank purchases around the world. Supply chain data enables you to study the bottle-necks in the supply chain and how shortages of goods can impact the price of the goods. Air travel data lets you analyze the traffic that different airliners receive and how it impacts their stock price.</p>
