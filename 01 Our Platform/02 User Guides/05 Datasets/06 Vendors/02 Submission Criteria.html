<p>Datasets must meet the following criteria to be considered for the Datasets Market:</p>

<ul>
    <li>A well-defined dataset with a clear and static vision for the data to minimize churn or changes.</li>
    <li>Robust ticker and security links to ensure the tickers are tracked well through time. ISIN, FIGI, or point-in-time tickers are  supported.</li>
    <li>Sufficient organizational funding to ensure at least 1 year of operation.</li>
    <li>Reliable API with no dead links or 502 errors.</li>
    <li>Consistent delivery schedule with data delivered on time and in time for trading.</li>
    <li>Consistent data format with notifications and lead time on data format updates.</li>
    <li>At least 1 year of historical data.</li>
    <li>Free of survivorship bias.</li>
    <li>Good documentation of the dataset.</li>
</ul>

<p>If the dataset is alternative data, in addition to the criteria above, the dataset must practice the Alternative Investment Standards defined by the non-profit Investment Data Standards Organization (IDSO). The Alternative Investment Standards outline the rules and best practices for collecting and distributing alternative datasets. For example, the IDSO <a href="https://www.investmentdata.org/publications">Web Crawling Best Practices publication</a> states that “a data collector should assess a website according to the terms of its robots.txt”.<br></p>
