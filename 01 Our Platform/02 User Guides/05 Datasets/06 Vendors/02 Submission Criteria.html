<p>To be considered for the Datasets Market, datasets must meet the following criteria:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Well-defined with robust ticker and Symbol links</li>
    <li>Delivered on time</li>
    <li>Ready for live trading</li>
    <li>At least 1 year of historical data</li>
    <li>Free of survivorship bias</li>
</ul>

<p>If the dataset is alternative data, in addition to the criteria above, the dataset must practice the Alternative Investment Standards defined by the non-profit Investment Data Standards Organization (IDSO). The Alternative Investment Standards outline the rules and best practices for collecting and distributing alternative datasets. For example, the IDSO <a href="https://www.investmentdata.org/publications">Web Crawling Best Practices publication</a> states that “a data collector should assess a website according to the terms of its robots.txt”.<br></p>
