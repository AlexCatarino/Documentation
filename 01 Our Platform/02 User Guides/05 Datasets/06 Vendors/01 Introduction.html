<p>Vendors are firms that list their datasets in the Dataset Market for use by QuantConnect members. We need Vendors to provide datasets so that members can search for alpha. We have a thorough vetting process so that only the best, most appropriate datasets are approved for listing in the Dataset Market. This page explains the submission, review, and integration process for new datasets.</p>
