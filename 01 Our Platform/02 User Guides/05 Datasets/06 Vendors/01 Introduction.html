<p>Vendors are firms that list their datasets in the Dataset Market for use by QuantConnect members. We need vendors to provide datasets so members can search for alpha. However, we have a thorough vetting process so that only the best, most appropriate datasets are approved for listing the Dataset Market. This page explains the submission, review, and integration process of new datasets.</p>
