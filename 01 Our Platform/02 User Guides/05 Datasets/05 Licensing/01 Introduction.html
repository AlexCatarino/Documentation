<p>You can license datasets in the Dataset Market to use in the cloud for live trading and research, to download locally, or to use in your Alpha Streams algorithm. We have contracts with the data providers in the Dataset Market that define the costs of each license. All of the datasets can be used in QC Cloud, but not all of the datasets can be downloaded or used in Alpha Streams algorithms. There are some free licenses, but we can't freely redistribute most of the datasets. This page explains each of the available licenses.</p>
