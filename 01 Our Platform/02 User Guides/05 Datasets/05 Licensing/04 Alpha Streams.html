<p>If you have an Alpha Streams license for a dataset, you can access the dataset in the Alphas that you license from the Alpha Streams market. Not all datasets support this license because datasets need to have at least 5 years of history to be used in Alpha Streams. The cost of this license is 2 basis points of your <a href="../alpha-streams-market/investing#03-Allocations">allocation</a>. The license fee is paid to the data Vendor when licensees subscribe to the Alpha.</p>
