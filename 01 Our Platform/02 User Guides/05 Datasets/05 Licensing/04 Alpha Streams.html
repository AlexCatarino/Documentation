<p>Access datasets in your Alpha Streams algorithms with the Alpha Streams license. Not all datasets support this license because datasets need to have at least 5 years of history to be used in Alpha Streams. If you have 3 or more algorithms listed in the Alpha Streams market, the license is free. Otherwise, the license costs the same as the Cloud license. The data provider is paid when investors subscribe to your algorithm by adding a charge of 2 basis points to the reserve price of your Alpha.</p>
