<p>Datasets are a stream of data points you use in your algorithms to make trading decisions and fill orders. Our Dataset Market is a portal where we aggregate datasets for you to use in your algorithms. Our Dataset Market includes price, fundamental, and alternative datasets. Consider using fundamental and alternative datasets to incorporate more information in your trading decisions. Fundamental and alternative datasets contain information that is not present in the price. Price data is commonly researched for trading ideas, so you may find it easier to discover alpha in other types of datasets.</p>

<p>The Dataset Market enables you to easily load datasets into your trading algorithms for use in the cloud or locally. The datasets come configured ready to integrate into your research and backtesting without any need for cleaning. The datasets in our market are vetted by the QuantConnect team to be high-quality, contain actionable information, and be free of survivorship-bias. Our Dataset Market is growing quickly. New datasets are added frequently.</p>


<p>The Dataset Market is a place to view, subscribe to, and download datasets. View the market to see all of the datasets that we have available. Each dataset has an example algorithm that you can clone to easily get started using the new dataset. Most datasets have an example research notebook to demonstrate how to use the dataset in the Research Environment. You can always view the dataset reviews to understand what other members think about the dataset. This page explains the layout of the Dataset Market to help you navigate the marketplace.<br></p>
