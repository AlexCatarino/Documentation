<p>When all of the QuantConnect members report the data issues they find, we can ensure the datasets are high quality for everyone. The easier it is for our Data Team to detect and reproduce the issue that's reported, the faster the issue is resolved. Data issue reports should include the following information:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Type of data issue (for example, a delisting error, name mapping error, or missing data points)</li>
    <li>Security ticker</li>
    <li>Start and end times</li>
    <li>Security type</li>
    <li>Market</li>
    <li>Resolution</li>
    <li>Description</li>
    <li>Attached backtest or research notebook that demonstrates the issue</li>
</ul>

<p>The data issue reporting area in the community forum includes a form so that you can provide the information above. If you encounter an issue with live data, report the issue to <a href="mailto:support@quantconnect.com">support@quantconnect.com</a> instead of opening a data issue. <br></p>
