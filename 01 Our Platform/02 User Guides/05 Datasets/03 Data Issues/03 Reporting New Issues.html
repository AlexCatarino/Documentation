<p>When all of the QuantConnect members report the data issues that they find, we can ensure the datasets are high quality for everyone. The easier it is for our Data Team to detect and reproduce the issue that's reported, the faster the issue is resolved. To ensure we can detect and reproduce the data issues that are reported, the reports should include the following information:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Type of data issue (for example, a delisting error, name mapping error, or missing data points)</li>
    <li>Security ticker</li>
    <li>Start and end times</li>
    <li>Security type</li>
    <li>Market</li>
    <li>Resolution</li>
    <li>Description</li>
    <li>Attached backtest or research notebook that demonstrates the issue</li>
</ul>

<p>If you find an issue with the historical data in a dataset, <a href="../../tutorials/datasets/inspecting-datasets#06-Report-Data-Issues">report it</a> in the Dataset Market. If you encounter an issue with live data, <a href="/contact">email us</a> a description of the issue.</p>
