	<div>What is the issue:</div>
	<div>- Our data can be slightly different from other platforms (like tradingview, trendspider, IBKR, and yahoo finance)</div>
	<div><br></div>

	<div>Why does the issue occur:<br></div>
	<div>-&nbsp; Because our data is institutional quality and those platforms all use BATS because it's cheaper for distribution. We don't strive to match poor-quality data. We use the CTA and UTP full tick feed which is the entire US tick feed 100% coverage, most charting websites use BATS which has very permissive display policies but is only about 5% of the market volume.<br></div>
