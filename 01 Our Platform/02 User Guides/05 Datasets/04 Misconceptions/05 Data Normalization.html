<p>Data normalization is a definition of how historical data should be adjusted to accommodate for splits and dividends,  When you compare data on QuantConnect to data hosted on other platforms, the data may have different values because a different data normalization technique is being used. Ensure datasets are using the same normalization mode before reporting data issues. The following table presents the data normalization modes we support:</p>

            Data Adjustment Modes

         </td>
         <td>
            <code>DataNormalizationMode.Adjusted</code>
            <p>Splits and dividends are backwards adjusted into the price of the asset. The price today is identical to current market price. For more information on this see Investopedia's article <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/adjusted_closing_price.asp">Adjusted Pricing</a>.

      <tr>
         <td width="30%">Raw</td>
         <td>
            <code>DataNormalizationMode.Raw</code>
            <p>No modifications to the asset price at all. Dividends are paid in cash; splits are applied directly to your portfolio quantity. </p>
         </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
         <td width="30%">SplitAdjusted</td>
         <td>
            <code>DataNormalizationMode.SplitAdjusted</code>
            <p>Only equity splits are applied to the price adjustment, while dividends are still paid in cash to your portfolio. This allows for management of the dividend payments (e.g. reinvestment) while still giving a smooth curve for indicators.</p>

      <tr>
         <td width="30%">TotalReturn</td>
         <td>
            <code>DataNormalizationMode.TotalReturn</code>
            <p> Return of the investment adding the dividend sum to the initial asset price. For more information on this see Investopedia's article <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/totalreturn.asp">Total Returns</a>.
