<p>Some of the datasets in our Dataset Market are timestamped with different timezones. Match the timezones between datasets to compare the correct times. Data providers collect and timestamp their datasets using whatever timezone that they want to use. We don't automatically adjust the time zones of datasets. We provide the raw data that comes from the data providers.</p>
