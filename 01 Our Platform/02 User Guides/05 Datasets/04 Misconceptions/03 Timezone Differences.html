<p>Match the timezones between datasets to compare the correct times. Some of the datasets in our Dataset Market are timestamped with different timezones. Data providers collect and timestamp their datasets using whatever timezone they want. We don't automatically adjust the time zones for members. We provide the raw data that comes from the data providers.</p>
