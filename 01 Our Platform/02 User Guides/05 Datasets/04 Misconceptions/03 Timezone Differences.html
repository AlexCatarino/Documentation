<p>Some of the datasets in our Dataset Market are timestamped with different timezones. Match the timezones between datasets to compare the correct times. Data providers collect and timestamp their datasets using whatever timezone they want to use. We don't automatically adjust the time zones of dataset. We provide the raw data that comes from the data providers.</p>
