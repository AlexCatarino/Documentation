<p>You may find our data can sometimes be slightly different from the data that's displayed on other platforms. The differences occur because our data is institutional quality while most of the other platforms use a cheaper alternative. We use the CTA and UTP full tick feed, which covers the entire US tick feed. In contrast, most charting websites use BATS, which has very permissive display policies but only covers about 5% of the total market volume.</p>
