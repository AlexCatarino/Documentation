<h4>Data should be the same across platforms</h4>- Our data can be slightly different from other platforms (like tradingview, trendspider, IBKR, and yahoo finance) because our data is institutional quality and those platforms all use BATS because it's cheaper for distribution. We don't strive to match poor-quality data. We use the CTA and UTP full tick feed which is the entire US tick feed 100% coverage, most charting websites use BATS which has very permissive display policies but is only about 5% of the market volume.<br></div><div><br><h4><a name="timezone"></a>Timezone</h4>
