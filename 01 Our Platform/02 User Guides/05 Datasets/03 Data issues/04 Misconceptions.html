<h4>Data should be the same across platforms</h4>What is the issue:</div><div>- Our data can be slightly different from other platforms (like tradingview, trendspider, IBKR, and yahoo finance)</div><div><br></div><div>Why does the issue occur:<br></div><div>-&nbsp; Because our data is institutional quality and those platforms all use BATS because it's cheaper for distribution. We don't strive to match poor-quality data. We use the CTA and UTP full tick feed which is the entire US tick feed 100% coverage, most charting websites use BATS which has very permissive display policies but is only about 5% of the market volume.<br></div><div><br><h4><a name="timezone"></a>Timezone</h4><div>What is the issue:</div><div>- Some of our datasets are timestamped with different timezones. Be sure to match the timezones between datasets to compare the correct times.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Why does the issue occur:</div><div>- Data providers collect and timestamp their datasets using whatever timezone they want. We don't automatically adjust the time zones for members.<br></div><div><br></div>

    <h4><a name="misaligned-timestamps"></a>Misaligned timestamps</h4>
    <div>What is the issue:</div><div>-When comparing our data to data hosted on other platforms, the timestamps can be different. <br></div><div><br></div><div>Why does the issue occur:</div><div>- We timestamp our data to when the data is received and ready to be used. For instance, we timestamp daily bars with the midnight of when the bar closed, not when it opened.<br></div><div>

    <h4><a name="data-normalization"></a>Data normalization</h4>
    <div>What is the issue:</div><div>-When comparing data across other platforms, the data normalization can be different so the data will look different.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Why does the issue occur:<br></div><div>
        - We offer options to view data in several different normalizations (redirect to data normalization docs). When comparing datasets, be sure they are in the same normalization mode.</div></div>
