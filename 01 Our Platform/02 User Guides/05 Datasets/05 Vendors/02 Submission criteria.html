<p>The Investment Data Standards Organization (IDSO) is a non-profit organization based in the United States that sets the Alternative Investment Standards. The standards outline the rules and best practices for collecting and distributing alternative datasets. For example, the IDSO <a href="https://www.investmentdata.org/publications">Web Crawling Best Practices publication</a> states that “a data collector should assess a website according to the terms of its robots.txt”. The data providers listed in the Data Market are screened to ensure they practice the Alternative Investment Standards.</p>
