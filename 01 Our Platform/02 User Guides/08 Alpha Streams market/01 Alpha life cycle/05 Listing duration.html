What is the listing duration:<br>-Alphas are listed until they have failed the live trading performance metrics (after the grace period)<br>-Authors can request to have their alpha removed from the marketplace at anytime but QuantConnect reserves the right to list an alpha for 1 year (refer to contract that’s in Author section)<br><br>Why is there a listing duration:<br><div>-To ensure the market is filled with high-quality alphas</div><div>-To churn out bad-performing (or overfit) alphas<br></div>-So if you’re invested in an alpha, if you want to keep invested in the alpha, we will keep the alpha for 1 year after it was published, even if the author wants to remove it.<div>
