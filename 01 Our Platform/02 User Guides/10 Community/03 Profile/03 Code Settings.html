platform, the Strategy Builder provides an easy way to get started 
building framework algorithms without writing any code. </div><div><br></div><div>Why disable the Strategy Builder:</div><div>- If you don't use the Strategy Builder, disable it so that new projects are created faster. You won't have to exit the Strategy Builder every time.</div><div><br></div><div><h4>Automatic Builds</h4></div><div>What are automatic builds:</div><div>- With automatic builds, the project you're working on will be built after every keystroke you make</div><div><br></div><div>Why enable automatic builds:</div><div>- You'll know if you've made a coding error right away, even before you go to manually build the project and run the backtest.</div><div>- It will save you time from having to build the project before running a backtest<br></div><div><br></div><div>Why disable automatic builds:</div><div>- Personal preferences</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - You may not want to see red lines &amp; pop-ups in the IDE before you've finished writing an entire line of code.</div><div>- The pop-ups can be distracting<br></div><div><br></div><div><h4>Code Completion</h4></div><div>What is code completion:</div><div>- GUI tool that shows options for auto-complete and presents the members that are accessible from the current object</div><div><i>- Redirect to Projects &gt; IDE &gt; Autocomplete and Intellisense docs</i><br></div><div><br></div><div>Why enable code completion:</div><div>- To speed up your development</div><div>- To reduce the number of times you need to use the API reference or API tree.</div><div><br></div><div>Why disable code completion:</div><div>- You may find the pop-ups distracting<br></div><div><br></div><div><h4>Parameter Highlighting</h4></div><div>What is parameter highlighting:</div><div>- Hard-coded parameter values are highlighted in the IDE</div><div><br></div><div>Why enable parameter highlighting:</div><div>- The IDE will be able to show where parameters were involved in the algorithm, giving you an idea of if the algorithm could be over-fit and pointing out locations where the algorithm could be made more general.<br></div><div>- Being notified of when you've added a parameter to your algorithm can help you develop more general algorithms with fewer parameters.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Why disable parameter highlighting:</div><div>- You find the pop-ups distracting<br></div><div><br></div><h4>Meta-Data Sharing</h4><div>What is meta-data:</div><div>- The backtest meta-data would include performance statistics, significant holdings, and the end of day equity curves. It would be just enough information to determine if the fund is interested to see it tested live in Alpha Streams. As always, no one can see your source-code and you own your algorithm intellectual property.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Why enable meta-data sharing:</div><div>- If we can see that your backtests have good results, you may be contacted for licensing opportunities before submiting an Alpha Streams algorithm<br></div><div><br></div><div>Why disable meta-data sharing:</div><div>- If you prefer to keep all of your backtest information private, you have the option to opt-out of meta-data sharing.<br></div><div></div>
