<p>Discussions are a set of forum posts and comments about a targeted subject. We occasionally post to forum discussions to announce new features, tutorials, and examples. You can contribute to any discussion if you have completed 30% of the Bootcamp lessons. You can create a discussion to connect with other members or to ask for guidance on a specific problem that you are facing. However, always perform your own research and tests before asking other members for assistance.</p>
