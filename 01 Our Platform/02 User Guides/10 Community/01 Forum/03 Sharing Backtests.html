<p>You can attach project files and backtest results to your forum comments. Sharing your project files is helpful in the following situations:</p>

<ul>
    <li>To request assistance</li>
    <li>To highlight an issue with data or Lean</li>
    <li>To share your addition to a discussion that's discussing strategies</li>
    <li>To share your interesting research and backtests with the community</li>
</ul>

<p>Sharing backtests is helpful in these situations because it enables other members to reproduce your results. However, since Lean is under constant development, old backtests that are attached to forum discussions can sometimes produce different results than they did in the past.</p>
