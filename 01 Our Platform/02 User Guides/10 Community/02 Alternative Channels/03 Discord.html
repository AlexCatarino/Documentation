<p>Join the <a href="https://discord.gg/PT7aBN2nkY">QuantConnect Discord server</a> to chat with community members and the core QuantConnect team in real-time. The benefits of using the Discord server instead of the forum are that you can send direct messages to community members, there are targeted discussion channels within the server, and new posts automatically display instead of you needing to refresh the forum page. The drawbacks of using the Discord server are that there are no QuantConnect Credit rewards, your activity isn't recorded on your QuantConnect profile page, and the content is not indexed by search engines, so answers get lost in history. It is also harder for our Support team to provide support in the Discord server than through the forum because Discord does not have built-in administrative tools for our Support team to organize support tickets.</p>
