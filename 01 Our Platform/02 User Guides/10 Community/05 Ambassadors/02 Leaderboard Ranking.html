<p>Community Ambassadors are ranked based on a general measurement of how helpful they are to the community members. The Community Ambassadors are ranked on a weekly basis. Ambassadors with the highest weekly rankings are designated as Gold Ambassadors and Ambassadors with the lowest weekly ranking are designated as Silver Ambassadors. You can <a href='../../tutorials/community/using-the-forum#14-View-Ambassador-Leaderboard'>see the current leaderboard rankings</a> in the <span class='page-section-name'>Community Ambassadors</span> section of the forum. Currently, only forum responses are considered in the ranking algorithm, but we are working on incorporating responses in the Discord server into the ranking algorithm.</p>
