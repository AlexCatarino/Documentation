<p>Community Ambassadors are ranked based on a general measurement of how helpful they are to the community members. The Community Ambassadors are ranked on a weekly basis. The Ambassadors with the highest weekly rankings are awarded the designation of Gold Ambassador and the Ambassadors with the lowest weekly ranking are awarded the designation of Silver Ambassador. You can see the current leaderboard rankings in the <b>Community Ambassadors</b> section of the forum. Currently, only forum responses are considered in the ranking algorithm, but we are working on incorporating responses in the Discord server into the ranking algorithm.</p>
