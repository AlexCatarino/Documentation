<p>You can engage with our team and community members through platforms outside of our forum. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://discord.gg/PT7aBN2nkY">Join the QuantConnect Discord server</a> to chat with community members and the core QuantConnect team in real-time. Since Discord messages are not indexed by search engines and Discord doesn't have built-in administrative tools for our Support team to organize support tickets, <a href='/docs/v2/our-platform/tutorials/organizations/requesting-support#03-Open-New-Tickets'>send support tickets</a> through the support system on our website.</p>
