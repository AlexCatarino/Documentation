In backtesting, you have a lot of data to process.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Research is a picture, backtesting is a movie, live trading is real life (emotion)<br>-Collaboration is not supported because it's not supported by Jupyter<br>-The reason for the file size limit on notebooks is because whenever there is a change to a file, the entire file is sent to our servers to save. </span><br><span style="font-size: 16px;"><span style="font-size: 16px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The file limit ensures a fast and successful upload/download communication.</span></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 16px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - For that reason, we encourage users to break up their files into manageable sizes. <br></span></div><div>
