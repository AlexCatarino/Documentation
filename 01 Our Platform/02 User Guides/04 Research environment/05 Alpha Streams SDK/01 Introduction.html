<div>What is the SDK:</div><div>-Software Development Kit (SDK) <br></div><div>-A tool to enable you to perform automated bulk alpha research, licensing, and correlation analysis</div><div>-implementations for both Python and C#, connected to the same REST API backend</div><div><br></div><div>Why use the SDK:</div><div><div>-can collect the insights from the alphas you have licensed from the Alpha Market and process them however you want</div>-Without this bundle, you need one brokerage account for every alpha</div><div>-Streamlines your alpha research</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>&lt;h3&gt;Generating lists</div><div>What:</div><div>-The SDK has a method to list of IDs for all of the alphas listed in the Alpha Market (GetAlphaList)</div><div>-The SDK has a method to list all of the tags given to alphas Alpha Market, along with the number of alphas that have the associated tag (GetAlphaTags)</div><div><br></div><div>Why use these:</div><div>-The alpha ID is needed to get more information on the alpha for further analysis</div><div>-Tags are useful because if you want to search for an alpha with a specific tag, you need to know what tags are currently used in the Alpha Market.</div><div>-The number of alphas that have a tag is useful information because if there is a low number of alphas with a certain tag, the alphas with that tag may have lower correlation with the other alphas in the market<br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>&lt;h3&gt;Inspecting alphas</div><div>What:</div><div>-There are methods in the SDK to gather information on a specific alpha:</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;
