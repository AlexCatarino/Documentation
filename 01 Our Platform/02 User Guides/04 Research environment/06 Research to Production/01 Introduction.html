<div>What is Research to Production:</div><div>- A tutorial series where we demonstrate how to research an idea in the Research environment and port the logic to the backtesting environment.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Why review Research to Production tutorials:<br></div><div>-With this series, you can see how to quickly take your ideas from the research notebook and implement them in an algorithm.</div><div>-You can clone these Research to Production projects for further research</div><div><br></div><div>Why use Research to Production techniques:<br></div><div>-It's easy to move logic from research to backtesting because QuantBook and QCAlgorithm are so simliar.</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp; - often you just need to assign `qb = self` in backtesting and then paste the research code</div><div>-Algorithm development should start in the research environment</div><div>
