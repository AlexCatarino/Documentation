<div>What is PyTorch:</div><div>- PyTorch is a Python package that provides two high-level features: 
tensor computation (like NumPy) with strong GPU acceleration and deep 
neural networks built on a tape-based autograd system. You can reuse 
your favorite Python packages such as NumPy, SciPy, and Cython to extend
 PyTorch when needed. <br></div><div><br></div><div>Supported models:</div><div>- <br></div><div></div>
