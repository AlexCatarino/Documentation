<p>If you have an Alpha Streams license for a dataset, you can access the dataset in the Alphas that you license from the Alpha Streams market. Not all datasets support this license because datasets need to have at least 2 years of history to be used in Alpha Streams. The cost of this license depends on the dataset. <a href="/docs/v2/our-platform/tutorials/datasets/inspecting-datasets#02-View-Dataset-Listing">Check the dataset listing page</a> in the Dataset Market to see the cost of the dataset that you want to license for Alpha Streams.</p>
