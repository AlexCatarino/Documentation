<p>In live trading, bars are built using a real-time clock with microsecond accuracy. However, it's possible for a tick to be counted in one bar during the backtest process and a different bar during the live process. This microsecond-by-microsecond processing of the ticks can mean that the individual bars between live and backtesting can have slightly different ticks that they use to compute the opening and closing bar prices. There is almost nothing we can do to resolve the issue. We do our best to accurately batch the stream of ticks we receive into bars.</p>
