<p>In live trading, bars are built using a real-time clock with microsecond accuracy. Unfortunately, it's possible for a tick to be counted in different bars between backtesting and live trading. This microsecond-by-microsecond processing of the ticks can mean that the individual bars between live trading and backtesting can have slightly different ticks that they use to compute the opening and closing bar prices. There is almost nothing we can do to resolve the issue. We do our best to accurately batch the stream of ticks we receive into bars.</p>
