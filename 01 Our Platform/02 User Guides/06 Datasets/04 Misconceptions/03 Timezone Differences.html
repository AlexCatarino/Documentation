<p>Datasets all have different timezones. Most price datasets are timestamped in Eastern Standard Time (EST). However, Future markets have more exotic timezones, depending on where the Future contract is trading. QuantConnect allows the raw data to be in different timezones. For US Equities, the timezone is EST. For Oanda Forex prices, the timezone is Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). In contrast, other charting platforms may display Oanda data with EST timestamps. Oanda Forex uses GMT, but Oanda CFD uses timezones relative to each of the CFD products that Oanda lists. QuantConnect accurately reflects all of these timezones from the relative markets that theyâ€™re trading.
