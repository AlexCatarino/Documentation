<p>You may find our data can sometimes be slightly different from the data that's displayed on other platforms. Most of the differences occur because our data is institutional quality while a lot of the other platforms use a cheaper alternative. We use the Consolidated Tape Association (CTA) and Unlisted Trading Privileges (UTP) tick feeds, which cover the entire US tick feed. In contrast, most charting websites use the Better Alternative Trading System (BATS), which has very permissive display policies but only covers about 25% of the total market volume.</p>
