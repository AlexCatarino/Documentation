<p>The data normalization mode defines how historical data is adjusted to accommodate for splits and dividends,  When you compare the data in the Dataset Market to data that's hosted on other platforms, the data may have different values because a different data normalization mode is being used to adjust the data. Ensure datasets are using the same normalization mode before reporting data issues. The following table explains the data normalization modes that we support:</p>

   <tbody>
      <tr>
         <td><code>Adjusted</code> (default)</td>
         <td>Splits and dividends are backward-adjusted into the price of the asset. The price today is identical to the current market price.

      </tr>
      <tr>
         <td><code>Raw</code></td>
         <td>No modifications to the asset price at all. Dividends are paid in cash and splits are applied directly to your portfolio quantity.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
         <td><code>SplitAdjusted</code></td>
         <td>Equity splits are applied to the price adjustment but dividends are paid in cash to your portfolio. This normalization mode allows you to manage dividend payments (e.g. reinvestment) while still giving a smooth time series of prices for indicators.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
         <td><code>TotalReturn</code></td>
         <td>Equity splits are applied to the price adjustment and the value of all future dividend payments is added to the initial asset price. For more information on this, view the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/totalreturn.asp">Total Returns</a> page on Investopedia.</td>
