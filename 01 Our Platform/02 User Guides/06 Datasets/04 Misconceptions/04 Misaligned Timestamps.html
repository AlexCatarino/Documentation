<p>When you compare the data in the Dataset Market to data hosted on other platforms, the timestamps can be different. Our price data is timestamped to the end of the data period because that's when the data is received and can be used. For instance, we timestamp our daily bars to midnight when the bar closed, not to midnight when the bar opened. In contrast, some other platforms use the start time of bars to timestamp the bars.</p>
