<div>############# Landing page content #######################</div><div>The Learning Center is a coding environment to learn quantitative trading using LEAN. The Learning Center features a collection of courses from educators from the QuantConnect team and the community. The goal of the Learning Center is to give you an understanding of
robust algorithm design and the tools you need to implement your own trading strategies. As
 you work through&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 16px;">the courses, </span>youâ€™ll manage a portfolio, use indicators
 in technical trading strategies, trade on universes of assets, automate
 trades based on market behavior, and understand how data moves through your algorithm. After you've completed a course, you can keep the code to perform further research and deploy to live trading. Start learning today because you need to complete 30% of the Bootcamp lessons to post in the community forum.<br></div><div>######################################################<br></div>

<p>The courses in the Learning Center are structured in a way so you can complete courses at your own pace. The course structure enables you to improve your skills in finance, statistics, and software development while learning the QuantConnect API in easily digestible portions. The idea behind the course lessons is to focus on implementing individual strategies rather than learning just the theory. The specific structure of courses is explained in the following sections.</p>
