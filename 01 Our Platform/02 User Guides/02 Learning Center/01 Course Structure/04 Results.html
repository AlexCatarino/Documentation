<p>To check if you have completed a task correctly, you need to run a backtest in the Learning Center environment. After you run your backtest, the result window displays the results of the backtest. If you receive an error message, you'll need to make some changes to the code and run the backtest again. If you pass the task, you'll be prompted to proceed to the next task in the course. If you're having trouble completing the task, you can copy the task solution file.</p>
