<p>Lessons are broken up into multiple tasks to test your understanding of the course. Each task is accompanied by text instruction to guide you to complete the task. The Learning Center environment, where you complete each task, is similar to the regular web IDE used for backtesting and live trading. After you read the task instructions and run your solution algorithm, you'll be informed if you did things correctly. If you need assistance, a hint and the solution file are available.</p>
