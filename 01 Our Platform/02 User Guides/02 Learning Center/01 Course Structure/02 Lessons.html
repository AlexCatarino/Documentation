<p>Courses are broken up into multiple lessons. Lessons are made up of videos, reading, and coding exercises. Lessons break up the process of learning into digestible tasks. Each lesson builds on an understanding of the API from the lesson before it, so completing the lessons in order is recommended. The introductory video of each lesson demonstrates the process of completing the tasks in the lesson before you implement them yourself.</p>
