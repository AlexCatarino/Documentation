<p>Courses are broken up into multiple lessons. Lessons are made up of videos, reading, and coding exercises. They break up the process of learning into digestible tasks. Each lesson builds on an understanding of the API from the lesson before it, so completing them in the order listed can feel intuitive. The introductory video of each lesson demonstrates the process of completing the tasks in the lesson before you implement it yourself.</p>
