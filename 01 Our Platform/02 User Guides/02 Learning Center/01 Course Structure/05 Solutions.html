<p>A solution file for each task is available in the Learning Center environment. You may use it, but we recommend trying to solve the problem before resorting to checking the solution file. You'll learn best by solving the problem on your own. However, errors can occur when running backtests, so you may use the solution file to ensure the environment running without error.</p>
