<p>Educators are QuantConnect experts who create Learning Center courses. We are always looking for experts to become Educators and share their insight with the community. As an Educator, you create the description, requirements, and lessons of each course. You also provide the images for the course listing in the Learning Center. As students complete your course, you'll receive course reviews to help you can refine your craft.</p>
