<p>The journey of raw data from its source to its integration with a trading platform can be complex. Alternative data is generally created through individuals, business processes, and sensors. Individuals create content on social media platforms, write reviews on e-commerce sites, and visit corporate Wikipedia pages. Businesses process transactions, file SEC reports, and issue company announcements. Sensors collect location data, gather satellite images, and monitor customer behavior. All of these forms of data can be captured and used to inform investment decisions in ways that augment traditional market and fundamental datasets. With over a million terabytes of data on the internet, there is virtually a limitless amount of information that can be informative for investors when analyzing a securityâ€™s performance in the marketplace.</p>
