<p>A challenge with working with alternative datasets is that it can be difficult to find a reliable data feed to use in live trading algorithms. Additionally, the high cost of acquiring the data for research and trading can be prohibitive for individuals. There can also be issues with quality in the data feeds. Alternative datasets are often less structured than the traditional market and fundamental data. For instance, if a data feed has survivorship bias, has insufficient history, or hasnâ€™t been cleaned and processed properly, the data feed can result in poor trading performance. </p>
