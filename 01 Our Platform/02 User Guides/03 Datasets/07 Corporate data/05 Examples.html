<p>A common example of using corporate data is using the industry classification attribute to target trading strategies at a particular industry. You can also use metrics from company financial statements like earnings per share, revenue growth, and R&D expenses to form portfolios. There is additional information included in our supported corporate dataset, including the full legal name of the company, the companyâ€™s fiscal year end, and the year the company was founded.
