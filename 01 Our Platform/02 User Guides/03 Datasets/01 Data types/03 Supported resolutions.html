<p>Resolution is the duration of time that was used to sample a data source. We support the following data resolutions:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Tick</li>
    <li>Second</li>
    <li>Minute</li>
    <li>Hour</li>
    <li>Daily</li>
    <li>End of day</li>
</ul>

<p>Daily resolution is different from end of day resolution because end of day resolution is sampled at a single point in time. For instance, the daily TradeBars that contain the open, high, low, close, and volume of a security are at the daily resolution. In contrast, the open interest of an options contract is classified as end of day resolution because open interest is calculated once per day but is only sampled at a single point in time.</p>

<p>Data density describes the frequency of entries in a dataset. Datasets at the tick resolution have dense data density. All other resolutions have regular data density. If a non-tick resolution dataset doesnâ€™t have an entry at each sampling, it has sparse density.</p>
