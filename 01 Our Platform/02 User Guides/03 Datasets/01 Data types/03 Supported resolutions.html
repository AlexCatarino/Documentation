<!-- 
<p>Resolution is the duration of time that was used to sample a data source. Data density describes the frequency of entries in a dataset. Datasets at the tick resolution have dense data density. All other resolutions have regular data density. If a non-tick resolution dataset doesnâ€™t have an entry at each sampling, it has sparse density. We support the following data resolutions:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Tick</li>
    <li>Second</li>
    <li>Minute</li>
    <li>Hour</li>
    <li>Daily</li>
</ul>
