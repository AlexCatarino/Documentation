<!-- 
<p>We support live data feeds for all security types that are supported for backtesting. However, we don’t have a live data feed for all of the datasets. In cases where we don’t have the live data feed, we support the data feed that comes from your brokerage. You don’t need to use the data feed from your brokerage though. For instance, you can use the Equities data provided by AlgoSeek in the Data Market but place trade through Interactive Brokers.</p>

<p>We support cash indices, but we don’t have a live feed for use in live trading. Similarly, we don’t have a live data feed for Equity Options, but we support Interactive Brokers Equity Option live data feed. To use the Interactive Brokers Equity Option live data feed, you need an active subscription to the data feed in your brokerage account. Even though Interactive Brokers has the data, we don’t support warrants or commodities. </p>
