<div>What is Atreyu:</div><div>-Atreyu was founded by George Kledaras and John Pyrovolakis in 2015 with the goal to connect quantitative managers to US markets. Atreyu provides access to trading Equities, Options, and Futures for all countries except those on the FinCen Anti-Money Laundering list. Atreyu doesn't have regulatory approval to trade for retail accounts, so clients have to be high net worth ($25M+) to open an account. Atreyu also provides onboarding services, risk-checks, order routing, and transaction cost analysis.<br></div><div>-Contains a shortable provider</div><div>-Text from lean.io/plugins</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - "US Equities brokerage for volume trading with the lowest latency and fees possible.
