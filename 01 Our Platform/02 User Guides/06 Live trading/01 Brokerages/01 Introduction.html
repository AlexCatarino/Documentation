### Landing page intro ####<br>What is live quant/algo trading:<br>-Running live algorithms that trade with real market participants, executed in an automated fashion<br><br>Why live trading:<br>-Live quant trading has less stress, less chance of addiction, less chance of rule breaking (because of algorithmic execution) than live discretionary trading<br><br>What is QC live trading:<br>-deploying your live algorithms using the QC platform (hardware and software/LEAN)<br><br>Why QC live trading:<br>-We have more than 100,000 live algorithms hosted [see QC homepage]<br>-We have &gt;$13B in volume traded on QC servers since 2015 [see homepage]<br>-QC live algorithms are profitable on x% of days (include live chart?)<br>-Your live algorithms are run on infrastructure maintained by QC engineers 24/7<br>-You live algorithms are run on co-located servers<br>-LEAN is open-source, no vendor lock-in<br><div>#######################</div><div><br></div><div>What is a brokerage:</div><div>-A connection to the exchanges so you can place orders</div><div><br></div><div>Why do I need a brokerage:</div><div>-QC can't place orders directly to an exchange.
