<div>What is a live data feed:</div><div>-A stream of security prices, 
bid/ask data, corporate actions, alt data, delivered directly into your 
trading algorithm during live execution<br></div><div><br></div><div>Why do I need a live data feed:</div><div>-You need a live data feed to inject data into your algorithm to make trading decision</div><div>-To respond quickly/instantaneously to market actions</div><div>-So you don't have to trade from delayed data (ex: Yahoo finance)</div><div><br></div><div>General for all datafeeds:<br></div><div>-You should choose a datafeed that updates the data that you have in your portfolio <br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 - For example: If you're trading US Options, the algorithm will accept 
the position on deployment but the price of the position will not be 
updated and the portfolio value will be wrong.<br></div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - You 
can trade the securities you don't have a datafeed for, but you'll 
receive a warning/error and the position value will not be correct since
 there is no datafeed updating the security value<div></div>
