<div>What are the limitations of notifications:</div><div>-Notifications only work in live algorithms. To prevent sending thousands of messages each time you run a backtest, all notifications are ignored in backtesting. <br></div><div>-We
 don’t envision the notification system to be used as a way to replace 
our brokerage integration. If your brokerage is not supported by LEAN, 
please contact us and we’ll try to integrate your brokerage.</div><div>-QuantConnect sources data from external vendors and must agree and 
uphold their license terms. These agreements do not allow redistribution
 of the live financial data. Because of this, you cannot use the 
notification system to distribute financial data to external clients.
