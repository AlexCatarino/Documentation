<div>What are the limitations of notifications:</div><div>-Notifications only work in live algorithms. To prevent sending thousands of messages each time you run a backtest, all notifications are ignored in backtesting. <br></div><div>-We

our brokerage integration. If your brokerage is not supported by LEAN, 
please contact us and we’ll try to integrate your brokerage.</div><div>-Notifications shouldn't be used to distribute market data. They should be used to inform yourself of the state of your algorithm<br></div>
