<div>-Lean does not synchronize the positions while the algorithm is 
running. We don't recommend "external" manual trading while the 
algorithm is 
running. If we need to intervene, the algorithm should be stopped and 
redeployed after the intervention. </div><div>-Alternatively, you can create manual trades when your live algorithm is running through the web GUI</div><div><div>-There are controls to stop the live algorithm</div><div>-You have the option to liquidate holdings</div><div>-Stop the algorithm if you want to stop trading or you need to make code changes</div>-You can place manual orders from the GUI if you need to</div><div></div>
