<div>In backtesting, orders are filled immediately. In live trading, orders are sent to the brokerage. Filling orders through the brokerage takes about half a second. Backtest orders that are submitted on stale data may have simulated fill prices that are different from the real 
  market price. This commonly happens when creating a 
  <a href="https://www.quantconnect.com/docs/algorithm-reference/scheduled-events">scheduled event</a> with an 
  incompatible data resolution. To avoid this, we recommend using the highest resolution data as much as possible such 
  as minute data, even if you only need hourly bars. This will give you an up to date price feed.
