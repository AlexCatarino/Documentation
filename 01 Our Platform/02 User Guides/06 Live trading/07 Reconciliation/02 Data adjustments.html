Sometimes data providers fix a bug that surfaced in their live data feed. Differences in performance can occur if 
  the data is corrected after the live algorithm views the original data but before the backtest algorithm views it. 
  For reference, all of our reported data issues are displayed 
  <a href="https://www.quantconnect.com/data/issues/open">here</a>. To fix this, closely review your order fill prices 
  to see if there were trade prices which seem unrealistic. This can be a signal of a live feed data error. It is rare
  to see an error in the live price; but it is common to miss a split or corporate event in live trading for smaller 
  companies. There are unfortunately no professional data feeds for corporate events.
