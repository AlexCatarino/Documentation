Although we go to great lengths to eliminate look-ahead bias with the 
  <a href="https://www.quantconnect.com/docs/key-concepts/understanding-time">Time Frontier</a>, it can still creep 
  into a backtest. For instance, if an algorithm integrates a 
  <a href="https://www.quantconnect.com/docs/algorithm-reference/importing-custom-data">custom data source</a> that is
  implemented to have look-ahead bias, the backtest may have different results than live trading. To ensure an 
  algorithm eliminates this bias, always set a period on your custom data types. The time the data is emitted will be 
  the Time + Period.
