The open-source LEAN algorithmic trading engine allows you to write algorithms with either C# or Python languages. You can create and manage projects files using the web IDE or the CLI. There is a list of third-party supported libraries you can use in your projects. If you need further customization, you can create your own libraries and import them into your QC projects.</p>
