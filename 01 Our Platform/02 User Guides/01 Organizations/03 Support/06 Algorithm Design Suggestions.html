<p>If you have a silver or gold support seat, we can offer suggestions on the design of your algorithms. Our Support Team members are experts on the inner workings of Lean, so we can guide you on improving the efficiency of your algorithms by following our common design patterns. We can usually reduce the size of your project's code files and increase the speed at which your project processes data points.</p>
