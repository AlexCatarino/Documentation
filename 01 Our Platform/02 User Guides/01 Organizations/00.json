Hardware resources are used to run backtests, launch research notebooks, deploy live trading \n  algorithms, and store project data. We offer several organization tiers so you can tailor your team's subscriptions as you \n  grow over time. For the times when you need access to a QuantConnect engineer to help solve development issues, assign support \n  seats among your team.
