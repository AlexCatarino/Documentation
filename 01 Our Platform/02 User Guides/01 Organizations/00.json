Hardware resources are used to run backtests, launch research notebooks, deploy live trading algorithms, and store project data. You can create new organizations and join existing ones. You can be a member in any number of organizations. We offer several organization tiers so you can tailor your team's subscriptions as you grow over time. For the times when you need access to a QuantConnect engineer to help solve development issues, assign support seats among your team. There are several tiers of support seats to match the level of support your team requires.</p>",
