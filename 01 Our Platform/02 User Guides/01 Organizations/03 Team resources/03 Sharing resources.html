<p>Hardware resources are shared among the organization members. Resource sharing promotes efficiency because it reduces the amount of time resource nodes spend idling. To see which resource nodes are available within an organization, check the <b><a href="https://www.quantconnect.com/organization/">Organization</a> > Resources</b> page in the Algorithm Lab or the Resource window on the right side of the web IDE. By default, the best performing resource is selected when running a backtest or launching a research notebook. However, the Resource window allows you to select a specific resource to use.</p>
