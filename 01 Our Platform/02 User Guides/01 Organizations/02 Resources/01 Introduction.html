<p>QuantConnect offers resources for running backtests, launching research notebooks, and deploying live trading algorithms to co-located servers. We have resources for storing data between backtests and during live trading via the ObjectStore. Our platform also has QuantConnect Credits (QCC) as a resource for your organization to run parameter optimization programs, access institutional-grade datasets, give to community members as a tip, or apply to your monthly invoice. To promote efficiency, all of these resources within an organization are shared among the organization members.</p>
