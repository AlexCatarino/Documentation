<p>The Free tier provides cloud access to datasets for all of the asset classes in our Datasets Market. The free data ranges from minute to daily resolutions and can be used to either run backtests or perform analysis in the Research Environment. When backtesting, Free organizations have access to our built-in auto-complete and debugging features in the web IDE. After a successful backtest, Free organizations can use our report generator to create professional-grade reports on the performance of their backtest. In terms of education, Free organizations have access to our online documentation, community forum, YouTube channel, and Learning Center.</p>
