<p>The Free tier provides cloud access to datasets for all of the asset classes in our Datasets Market. The resolution of the free data ranges from minute to daily and it can be used to perform analysis in the Research Environment or it can be used to run backtests. Free organizations start with one free backtest node and one free research node. When backtesting, Free organizations have access to our built-in auto-complete and debugging features in the web IDE. After a successful backtest, Free organizations can use our report generator to create professional-grade reports on the performance of their backtest. In terms of education, Free organizations have access to our online documentation, community forum, YouTube channel, and Learning Center.</p>
