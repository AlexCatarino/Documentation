<p>The Team tier builds on the features included in the <a href="/docs/v2/our-platform/user-guides/organizations/tier-features#03-Quant-Researcher-Tier">Quant Researcher tier</a>. Organizations on the Team tier can have up to 10 members and the members can collaborate on projects together. These organizations can produce 1MB of logs/backtest, 10MB of logs/day, and there is no limit on the number of orders that they can place in backtests. Organizations on the Team tier can have up to 10 backtesting nodes, 10 research nodes, and 10 live trading nodes. To accommodate the large number of projects in Team organizations, these organizations can expand the capacity of their ObjectStore up to 10GB. Annual contracts for onboarding services are provided to these organizations to get them operational in the shortest amount of time. When live trading, Team organizations have more options than the lower tiers because both the <a href='/docs/v2/our-platform/user-guides/live-trading/brokerages/trading-technologies'>Trading Technologies brokerage</a> and our <a href='/docs/v2/our-platform/user-guides/live-trading/data-feeds#02-QuantConnect-Data-Feed'>live Futures data feed</a> are available.</p>
