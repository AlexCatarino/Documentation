<p>The Institution tier builds on the features included in the Trading Firm tier. Organizations on the Institution tier have no limit on the amount of backtest logs they can produce.

These organizations can request custom libraries and frameworks to use in the QuantConnect web IDE. Additionally, Institution organizations can receive instant messaging support from a QuantConnect engineer.</p>
