 organization is a collection of members that share hardware 
resources, share access to datasets, and collaborate 
  together to develop projects. Hardware resources are used to run 
backtests, launch research notebooks, deploy live trading 
  algorithms, and store project data. You can create new organizations 
and join existing ones. You can be a member in any number of organizations. We offer several organization 
tiers so you can tailor your team's subscriptions as you 
  grow over time. For the times when you need access to a QuantConnect 
engineer to help solve development issues, assign support 
  seats among your team. There are several tiers of support seats to 
match the level of support your team requires.

Each account starts with a personal organization on the Free tier with access to one free backtest node and one free research node. However, to accommodate the growth of your trading skills and business, you can adjust the tier of your organization at any time. Higher tiers offer more live nodes to run more live algorithms, more backtesting nodes for faster concurrent backtesting, and many other features.</p><div><!--
