<p>The <b><a href="https://www.quantconnect.com/organization/">Organization</a> > Billing</b> page gives you an overview of your payment details. It shows the last 4 digits of the credit card registered to your account and the associated billing information. The billing information can be edited in the <b><a href="https://www.quantconnect.com/organization/">Organization</a> > Billing</b> page. Your billing information is never saved by QuantConnect. Itâ€™s passed to the Stripe billing system.</p>

<p>At the top of the <b><a href="https://www.quantconnect.com/organization/">Organization</a> > Billing</b> page, you can see the value of your next invoice and your next billing date. Organizations are billed on a monthly frequency and the bill is paid at the beginning of the monthly service. The organization owner is responsible for the billing, but the responsibility can be delegated in Trading Firm or Institution organizations.</p>

<p>The Product section on the <b><a href="https://www.quantconnect.com/organization/">Organization</a> > Billing</b> page lists a breakdown of all the services you are subscribed to and the individual costs of those services that compose the total bill. If you want to change your subscriptions, visit the <a href="https://www.quantconnect.com/pricing">Pricing</a> page. If you cancel your subscription, live trading is halted. Therefore, for user safety, subscriptions automatically renew each month.</p>
