<p>Each member of your organization will have access to the resources available. However, if you are the manager of a Trading Firm or Institution organization, you can also grant various permissions to your members. There are several categories of permissions you can grant to members, including the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Node permissions - The ability to create, stop, and delete resource nodes.</li>
    <li>Team permissions - The ability to add members, remove members, and edit member permissions.</li>
    <li>Storage permissions - The ability to add data to the ObjectStore, remove data from the ObjectStore, and subscribe to more ObjectStore storage space.</li>
    <li>Alpha token permissions - The ability to create, delete, and read tokens that are used to access the Alpha Streams SDK.</li>
    <li>Alpha exchange permissions - The ability to read from the Alpha Streams exchange.</li>
</ul>
