<p>The <b>Billing</b> page provides an overview of your organization's payment details. It shows the last 4 digits of the credit card registered to your account and the associated billing information. If you have permission to update billing with the organization, you can edit the billing information from the <b>Billing</b> page. Your organization's billing information is never saved by QuantConnect. Instead, itâ€™s passed to the Stripe billing system.</p>

<p>Organizations are billed on a monthly frequency and the bill is paid at the beginning of the monthly service. At the top of the <b>Billing</b> page, you can see the value of your next invoice and your next billing date. The organization owner is responsible for the billing, but the responsibility can be delegated in Trading Firm or Institution organizations.</p>

<p>The <b>Product</b> section on the <b>Billing</b> page lists a breakdown of all the services you are subscribed to and the individual costs of those services that compose the total bill. If you want to change your subscriptions, visit the <a href="https://www.quantconnect.com/pricing">Pricing</a> page. If you cancel your subscription, live trading is halted. Therefore, for user safety, subscriptions automatically renew each month.</p>

<h4>QCC</h4>
<p>QuantConnect Credit (QCC) is credit with an organization that can be purchased to run parameter optimizations, download datasets, give tips to members in the forum, or apply to the organization's monthly invoice to pay for subscriptions. All of the members within an organization have the ability to spend the QCC balance.</p>
