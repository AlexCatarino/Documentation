<p>If you create a project, you own the IP rights of the project. If you are in a Team organization and add collaborators to your project, the collaborators can clone your project, but the original project belongs to you since you created it. If you are in a Trading Firm or Institution organization, the organization owns all of your projects that are within the organization, even if you're collaborating with the organization as an external consultant.</p>
