<p>The Algorithm Lab provides services for organizations to set up billing and assign permissions to members within the organization. Each organization type has a limit on the number of members that can join the organization. When you’re part of multiple organizations, you unlock the ability to migrate projects from any organization you own to any other organization you’re in. Each organization can customize their image, name, and description to match their own branding.</p>
