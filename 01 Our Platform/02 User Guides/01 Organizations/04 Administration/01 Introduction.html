<p>The Algorithm Lab lets you set up billing, assign permissions to members, and manage the members of your organization. Each organization tier has a limit on the number of members that can join the organization. If youâ€™re part of multiple organizations, you unlock the ability to migrate projects from any organization that you own to any other organization in which you're a member. In addition to managing billing and members, you can customize your organization's image, name, and description in the Algorithm Lab to match your unique branding.</p>
