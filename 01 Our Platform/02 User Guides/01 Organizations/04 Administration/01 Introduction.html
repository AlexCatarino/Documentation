<p>The Algorithm Lab provides services for organizations to set up billing, assign permissions to members, and manage the members within the organization. Each organization tier has a limit on the number of members that can join the organization. When youâ€™re part of multiple organizations, you unlock the ability to migrate projects from any organization you own to any other organization in which you're a member. In addition to managing billing and members, each organization can customize its image, name, and description to match its unique branding.</p>
