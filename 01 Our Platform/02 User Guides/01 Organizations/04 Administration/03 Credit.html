<p>To enable micropayments on QuantConnect, we have created QuantConnect Credit (QCC). You can use QCC to perform the following actions:</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="../optimization">Optimize parameters</a></li>
    <li>Download datasets</li>
    <li><a href="community/forum#04-QCC">Gift to members in the forum</a></li>
    <li><a href="../../tutorials/organizations/billing#06-Apply-QCC-to-an-Invoice">Apply to your organization's monthly invoice</a></li>
</ul>

<p>You can <a href="../../tutorials/organizations/billing#05-Purchase-QCC">purchase QCC</a> in the Algorithm Lab. The conversion rate is 1 QCC = $0.01 USD. Since QCC is owned by organizations instead of members, all of the members within your organization have the ability to spend the QCC balance.</p>
