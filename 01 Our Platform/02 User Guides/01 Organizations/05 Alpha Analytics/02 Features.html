<p>The <a href="https://github.com/QuantConnect/AlphaStreams">Alpha Streams software development kit</a> (SDK) has a REST client that enables you to perform various actions to streamline your alpha research. The SDK has implementations for both Python and C#. Both of these language implementations are connecting to the same REST API backend. By using the SDK, you can perform the following actions:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Request details about a specific alpha</li>
    <li>Get information about a specific author</li>
    <li>Get the errors for a specific alpha</li>
    <li>Get the equity curve of a specific alpha</li>
    <li>Get a list of all alpha IDs</li>
    <li>Get the orders and OrderEvents for a specific alpha</li>
    <li>Get the current holdings of a specific alpha</li>
    <li>Download all orders of an alpha and save them to file</li>
    <li>Search for alpha that match specific criteria</li>
    <li>Search for authors that match specific criteria</li>
    <li>Create and remove bids for alphas</li>
    <li>Get details about a bid for a specific alpha</li>
</ul>
