<p>An organization is an entity in the QuantConnect ecosystem where you can gather with members to share hardware resources, share datasets, and collaborate on projects. You need an organization to gain access to the QuantConnect servers. A default personal organization is created for every account, but you can also create new organizations and join existing ones. Organizations can have multiple users and there is no limit on the number of organizations you can join.</p>
