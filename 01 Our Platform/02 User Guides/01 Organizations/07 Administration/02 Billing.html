<p>The <b>Organization > Billing</b> page gives you an overview of your payment details. It shows the last 4 digits of the credit card registered to your account and the associated billing information. The billing information can be edited in the <b>Organization > Billing</b> page. Your billing information is never saved by QuantConnect. Itâ€™s passed to the Stripe billing system.</p>

<p>At the top of the <b>Organization > Billing</b> page, you can see the value of your next invoice and your next billing date. Organizations are billed on a monthly frequency. The organization owner is responsible for the billing, but the responsibility can be delegated in Trading Firm or Institution organizations.</p>

<p>The Product section on the <b>Organization > Billing</b> page lists a breakdown of all the services you are subscribed to and the individual costs of those services that compose the total bill. If you want to change your subscriptions, visit the <a href="https://www.quantconnect.com/pricing">Pricing</a> page.</p>
