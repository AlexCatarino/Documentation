<p>Live trading algorithms are run on co-located servers racked in Equinix. By running your algorithms on co-located servers, your algorithm receives market data faster than if you were to deploy the algorithm on your local machine. If you send an order to your brokerage on our co-located servers, the order takes about half a second to fill, so your trading strategies can't be ultra high-frequency but you can reliably deploy intraday strategies. In addition to faster execution and order fills, co-location also reduces several factors that can interfere with your algorithm, including downtime from internet outages, equipment repairs, and natural disasters. </p>
