<p>The Interactive Brokers (IB) data feeds are streams of Equity, Futures, and Options prices directly from IB. The data feed is created by reporting the trades and quotes made through IB. In contrast, our data feed consolidates the trades and quotes across all of the exchanges. To use IB data feeds in your algorithms, <a href="https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/software/cp/am/settings/marketdatasubscriptions.htm">subscribe to IB market data</a>. We support all of the IB data subscriptions that are related to <a href="brokerages/interactive-brokers#03-Asset-Classes">the securities that we support</a>. Members usually subscribe to the following IB market data:</p>

<ul>
    <li>US Securities Snapshot and Futures Value Bundle</li>
    <li>US Equity and Options Add-On Streaming Bundle</li>
</ul>

<p>If you deploy a live algorithm with the IB brokerage, you can use the QC data feed, the IB data feed, or both. If you use just the IB data feed, you can't use universe selection in your algorithms because the data for coarse and fine universe selection is part of the QC data feed.</p>
