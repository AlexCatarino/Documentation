<p>The Interactive Brokers (IB) data feeds are streams of Equity, Futures, and Options prices directly from Interactive Brokers. The data feed is created by reporting the trades and quotes made through IB. In contrast, our data feed consolidates the trades across all exchanges. To use IB data feeds in your algorithms, subscribe to the appropriate <a href="https://www.interactivebrokers.ca/en/accounts/fees/marketData.php?ib_entity=usa">data subscriptions in your IB account</a>. If you deploy a live algorithm with the IB brokerage, you can use the QC data feed, the IB data feed, or both.</p>
