<p>The alternative datasets in your live trading algorithms are polled for new data points at various frequencies, depending on the resolution of your dataset subscription. As we receive new data points, they are immediately injected into your algorithm. The following list shows the polling frequency of each resolution:</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Daily</b>: Every 30 minutes</li>
    <li><b>Hour</b>: Every 30 minutes</li>
    <li><b>Minute</b>: Every minute</li>
    <li><b>Second</b>: Every second</li>
    <li><b>Tick</b>: Constantly polled</li>
</ul>

<p>The timestamps of alternative data can be in various timezones, including UTC, NY, and Chicago. <a href="../../tutorials/datasets/inspecting-datasets#02-View-Dataset-Listing">Check the dataset listing page</a> to see the timezone of the dataset that you're using.</p>
