<p>Data feeds are a stream of security trades, quotes, corporate actions, and alternative data factors delivered to your trading algorithm during live execution. You need live data feeds to inject data into your algorithm so that you can make real-time trading decisions and so that the values of the securities in your portfolio are updated. For instance, if you're trading US Options, your position values will usually be read from your brokerage account when you deploy the algorithm, but your position values can only be updated as the algorithm progresses if you have a data feed for US Options. You can trade securities for which you don't have a data feed, but you'll receive a warning and the position value will not be updated over time.</p>

<p>You can currently only use 1 data feed in your live algorithm, but we are working on adding support for multiple data feeds. Subscribe to <a href="https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean/pull/6047">GitHub Issue #6047</a> to track our progress in adding the functionality. This page explains the data feeds that are currently supported and how they operate.</p>
