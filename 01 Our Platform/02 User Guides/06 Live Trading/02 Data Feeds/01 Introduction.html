<p>Data feeds are a stream of security trades, quotes, corporate actions, and alternative data factors delivered to your trading algorithm during live execution. You need live data feeds to inject data into your algorithm so that you can make real-time trading decisions. You can only use 1 data feed in your live algorithm, so select the data feed that updates the value of the securities in your portfolio. For example, if you're trading US Options, the position value will usually be read from your brokerage account when the algorithm is deployed, but the value of the position can only be updated as the algorithm progresses if you have the US Options data feed. You can trade securities for which you don't have a data feed, but you'll receive a warning and the position value will not be updated over time. This page explains the data feeds that are available and how they operate.</p>
