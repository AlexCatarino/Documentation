<div>### Live trading landing page intro ####<br>What is live quant/algo trading:<br>-Running live algorithms that trade with real market participants, executed in an automated fashion<br><br>Why live trading:<br>-Live
 quant trading has less stress, less chance of addiction, less chance of
 rule breaking (because of algorithmic execution) than live 
discretionary trading<br><br>What is QC live trading:<br>-deploying your live algorithms using the QC platform (hardware and software/LEAN)<br><br>Why QC live trading:<br>-We have more than 100,000 live algorithms hosted [see QC homepage]<br>-We have &gt;$13B in volume traded on QC servers since 2015 [see homepage]<br>-QC live algorithms are profitable on x% of days (include live chart?)<br>-Your live algorithms are run on infrastructure maintained by QC engineers 24/7<br>-You live algorithms are run on co-located servers<br>-LEAN is open-source, no vendor lock-in<br><div>#######################</div></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>What is a live data feed:</div><div>-A stream of security prices, 
bid/ask data, corporate actions, alt data, delivered directly into your 
trading algorithm during live execution<br></div><div><br></div><div>Why do I need a live data feed:</div><div>-You need a live data feed to inject data into your algorithm to make trading decision</div><div>-To respond quickly/instantaneously to market actions</div><div>-So you don't have to trade from delayed data (ex: Yahoo finance)</div><div><br></div><div>General for all datafeeds:<br></div><div>-You should choose a datafeed that updates the data that you have in your portfolio <br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 - For example: If you're trading US Options, the algorithm will accept 
the position on deployment but the price of the position will not be 
updated and the portfolio value will be wrong.<br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - You 
can trade the securities you don't have a datafeed for, but you'll 
receive a warning/error and the position value will not be correct since
 there is no datafeed updating the security value</div><div><br></div><div>Limitations:</div><div>- You can only use 1 data feed in your live algorithm<br></div><div></div>
