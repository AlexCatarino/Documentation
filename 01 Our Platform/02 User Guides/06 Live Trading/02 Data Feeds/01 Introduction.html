<div>### Live trading landing page intro ####</div><div>QuantConnect enables you to run your algorithms in live mode with real-time market data. Live
 quant trading has less stress, less chance of addiction, less chance of
 rule-breaking than live 
discretionary trading because of the automated execution. Deploy your algorithms using QuantConnect because our infrastructure is battle-tested. We have successfully hosted more than 100,000 live algorithms and have had more than $13B in volume traded on our servers since 2015. Our member algorithms are run on co-located servers and the trading infrastructure is maintained at all times by our team of engineers. Our LEAN trading engine is also open-source, so you are never prone to vendor lock-in.<br></div><div><div>#######################</div></div>

<p>Data feeds are a stream of security trades, quotes, corporate actions, and alternative data factors delivered to your trading algorithm during live execution. You need live data feeds to inject data into your algorithm to make real-time trading decisions. You can only use 1 data feed in your live algorithm, so you should select the data feed that updates the value of the securities that you have in your portfolio. For example, if you're trading US Options, the position value will be read from your brokerage account when the algorithm is deployed, but the value of the position can only be updated as the algorithm progresses if you have the US Options data feed. You can trade securities for which you don't have a data feed, but you'll receive a warning and the position value will not be updated. This page explains the data fees that are available and how they work.</p>
