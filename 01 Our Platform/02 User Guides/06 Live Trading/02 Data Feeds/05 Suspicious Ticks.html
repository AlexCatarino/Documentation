<p>Tick data is raw and unfiltered, so it can contain a lot of noise. We flag some ticks as suspicious if they are not tradable. Since they are not tradable, suspicious ticks shouldn't be used in your backtests or considered informative in live trading. We flag ticks as suspicious in the following situations:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The tick occurs below the best bid quote or above the best ask quote.</li>
    <img style="max-width:100%" src="https://cdn.quantconnect.com/i/tu/suspicious-tick-above-best-ask.png">
    <li>The tick occurs far from the current market price.</li>
    <img style="max-width:100%" src="https://cdn.quantconnect.com/i/tu/suspicious-tick-near-zero.png">
    <li>The tick occurs on a dark pool, which isn't tradable.</li>
</ul>

<p>We only recommend advanced users incorporate their own tick filtering process. You can ignore the suspicious flag and just accept every tick that is injected into your algorithm.</p>
