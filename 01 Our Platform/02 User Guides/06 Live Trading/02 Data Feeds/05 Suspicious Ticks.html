<p>Tick data is raw and unfiltered, so it can contain a lot of noise. If a tick is not tradable, we flag it as suspicious and don't include it in our <code>TradeBar</code>s and <code>QuoteBar</code>s. If you use tick data, you should avoid using suspicious ticks in your algorithms as informative data points. We recommend only using tick data if you understand the risks and are able to perform your own tick filtering. Ticks are flagged as suspicious in the following situations:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The tick occurs below the best bid or above the best ask. See Figure 1 for an example.</li>
    <p><b>Figure 1</b></p>
    <p><i>Suspicious Tick Above the Best Ask</i></p>

    <p><i>Note.</i> This figure shows a tick that occurred above the best ask price of a security. The green line represents the best ask of the security, the blue line represents the best bid of the security, and the red dots represent trade ticks. The ticks between the best bid and ask occur from filling hidden orders. The tick that occurred above the best ask price is flagged as suspicious.<br></p>
    <li>The tick occurs far from the current market price. See Figure 2 for an example.</li>

    <p><i>Suspicious Tick Far From the Market Price</i></p>

    <p><i>Note.</i> This figure shows a tick that occurred far from the price of the security. The red dots represent trade ticks. The tick that occurred far from the market price is flagged as suspicious. </p>
    <li>The tick occurs on a dark pool.</li>
    <li>The tick is rolled back.</li>
    <li>The tick is reported late.</li>
