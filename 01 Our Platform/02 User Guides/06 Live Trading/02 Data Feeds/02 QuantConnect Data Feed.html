<p>Our data feed consolidates market data across all the exchanges. You can use our data feed when you trade Equities, Crypto, Forex, CFDs, and Futures through any of our <a href='brokerages'>supported brokerages</a>. Our data feed is powered by the Securities Information Processor (SIP) so it has 100% market coverage. In contrast, free data feeds like the Better Alternative Trading System (BATS) only have about 25% market coverage.</p>
