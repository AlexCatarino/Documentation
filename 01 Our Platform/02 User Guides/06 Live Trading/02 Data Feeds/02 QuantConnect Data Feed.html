<p>Our data feed consolidates market data across all the exchanges. You can use our data feed when trading Equities, Crypto, Forex, CFDs, and Futures through any of our supported brokerages. Our data feed is powered by the Securities Information Processor (SIP) so it has 100% market coverage. In contrast, free data feeds like the Better Alternative Trading System (BATS) only have about 25% market coverage.</p>
