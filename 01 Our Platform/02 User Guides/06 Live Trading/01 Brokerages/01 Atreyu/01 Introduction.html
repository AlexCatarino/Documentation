<p>Atreyu was founded by George Kledaras and John Pyrovolakis in 2015 with the goal to connect quantitative managers to US markets. Atreyu provides access to US prime brokers for clients from all countries that are not on the FinCen Anti-Money Laundering list. In addition to market access, Atreyu provides information about short availability. Atreyu doesn't have regulatory approval to trade for retail accounts, so you need to be a high net worth ($25M+) individual or firm to open an account.</p>
