<p>Orders filled with the Kraken brokerage model are subject to a 0.16% maker fee and a 0.26% taker fee by default. If you add liquidity to the order book by placing a limit order that doesn't cross the spread, you pay maker fees. If you remove liquidity from the order book by placing an order that crosses the spread, you pay taker fees. If you trade a pair where the base currency is any of the following currencies, the fee is 0.2%:</p>

<ul>
    <li>CAD</li>
    <li>EUR</li>
    <li>GBP</li>
    <li>JPY</li>
    <li>USD</li>
    <li>USDT</li>
    <li>DAI</li>
    <li>USDC</li>
</ul>

<p>Fees are paid in the quote currency when buying and in the base currency when selling by default. However, these can be overridden by defining the <code>KrakenOrderProperties</code>.</p>
