<p>Coinbase was founded by Brian Armstrong and Fred Ehrsam in 2012 with the goal to "increase economic freedom in the world"<sup><a href="https://www.coinbase.com/mission">1</a></sup>. Coinbase provides access to trading Cryptocurrencies for clients in over 100 countries<sup><a href="https://www.coinbase.com/places">2</a></sup> with no minimum deposit. Coinbase also provides a self-hosted Crypto wallet, a Visa debit rewards card, and Bitcoin collateral-backed lines of credit. The former name of Coinbase and Coinbase Pro was GDAX, so the <code>GDAXBrokerageModel</code> connects to the brokerage connection in live trading and simulates order fills in backtesting.</p>
