<p>Check the <a href="https://help.coinbase.com/en/pro/trading-and-funding/trading-rules-and-fees/fees"><b>What are the fees on Coinbase Pro?</b></a> page on the Coinbase website to see the live trading order fees. In backtests, the fees are modeled with the <code>GDAXFeeModel</code>, which charges a maker and taker fee. If you add liquidity to the order book by placing a limit order that doesn't cross the spread, you pay maker fees. If you remove liquidity from the order book by placing an order that crosses the spread, you pay taker fees. Before 2019/3/23 1:30am UTC, the <code>GDAXFeeModel</code> charges a 0% maker fee and a 0.3% taker fee. After 2019/3/23 1:30am UTC, the model charges a 0.15% maker fee and a 0.25% taker fee. The <code>GDAXFeeModel</code> does not currently model your 30-day trading volume to adjust the fees.</p>
