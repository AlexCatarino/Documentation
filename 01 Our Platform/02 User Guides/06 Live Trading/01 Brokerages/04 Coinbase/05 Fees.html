<p>Orders filled with the Coinbase brokerage are subject to maker and taker fees. We don't currently model the 30-day volume to select the fee tier. Before 2019/3/23 1:30am UTC, orders are subject to a 0% maker fee and a 0.3% taker fee. After 2019/3/23 1:30am UTC, orders are subject to a 0.15% maker fee and a 0.25% taker fee. Maker fees are paid when you add liquidity to the order book by placing a limit order that doesn't cross the spread. Taker fees are paid when you remove liquidity from the order book by placing an order that crosses the spread.</p>
