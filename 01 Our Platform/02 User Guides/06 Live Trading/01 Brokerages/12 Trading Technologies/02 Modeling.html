<p>The <code>TradingTechnologiesBrokerageModel</code> does not have specific modeling for fees and slippage because TT is not a real brokerage. In live trading, TT reports the total fees of your orders after each order fill. Pass a different <code>BrokerageName</code> to <code>SetBrokerageModel</code> to backtest your algorithm with fee and slippage modeling. The brokerage model you set should support the asset classes and orders in your algorithm.</p>
