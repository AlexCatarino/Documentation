  "content" : "<p>A brokerage is your connection to the exchanges so that you can place orders. QuantConnect canâ€™t place orders directly on your behalf because we are an intermediary. Brokerages supply a connection to the exchanges so that you can automate orders using LEAN. All data comes through QuantConnect when live trading, except when using the Interactive Brokers brokerage. Go directly to the brokerage and open up an account before deploying a trading algorithm with them. A list of all our supported brokerages is displayed below. New brokerages can be added if the brokerage has an API that is officially supported by the brokerage, open-source, popular, and stable. If you want to add a new brokerage to the platform, <a href='/contact'>contact us</a>.</p>",
