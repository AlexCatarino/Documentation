<p>Orders filled with the FTX brokerage model are subject to a 0.02% maker fee and a 0.07% taker fee. You pay maker fees when you add liquidity to the order book by placing a limit order that doesn't cross the spread. You pay taker fees when you remove liquidity from the order book by placing an order that crosses the spread. The fees are charged in the base currency for maker orders and the quote currency for taker orders. The <code>FTXFeeModel</code> does not currently model your 30-day trading volume or FTT holdings to adjust the maker and taker fees.</p>
