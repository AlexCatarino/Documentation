<p>Check the <a href="https://help.ftx.com/hc/en-us/articles/360024479432-Fees"><b>Fees</b></a> page on the FTX website to see the live trading order fees. In backtests, the fees are modeled with the <code>FTXFeeModel</code>, which charges a 0.02% maker fee and a 0.07% taker fee. If you add liquidity to the order book by placing a limit order that doesn't cross the spread, you pay maker fees. If you remove liquidity from the order book by placing an order that crosses the spread, you pay taker fees. You pay the fees in the base currency for maker orders and the quote currency for taker orders. The <code>FTXFeeModel</code> does not currently model your 30-day trading volume and FTT balance to adjust the fees.</p>
