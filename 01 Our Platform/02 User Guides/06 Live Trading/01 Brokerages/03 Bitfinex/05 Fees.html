<p>Orders filled with the Bitfinex brokerage are subject to a 0.1% maker fee and a 0.2% taker fee. Maker fees are paid when you add liquidity to the order book by placing a limit order that doesn't cross the spread. Taker fees are paid when you remove liquidity from the order book by placing an order that crosses the spread. If you place a limit order that hits a hidden order, you are charged the maker fee. The <code>BitfinexFeeModel</code> does not currently model your 30-day trading volume.<br></p>
