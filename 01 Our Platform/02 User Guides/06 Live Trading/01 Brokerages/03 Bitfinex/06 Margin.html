<h4>Buying Power</h4>
<p>The Bitfinex brokerage uses the <code>CashBuyingPowerModel</code> buying power model for cash accounts and the <code>SecurityMarginModel</code> buying power model with a leverage of 3.3 for margin accounts. The <code>SecurityMarginModel</code> implements Regulation T rules.</p>

<h4>Margin Calls</h4>
<p>Regulation T margin rules are enforced with the <code>DefaultMarginCallModel</code>. When the amount of margin remaining in the portfolio drops below 5% of total portfolio value, a warning is sent. When the amount of margin remaining in the portfolio drops to zero or goes negative, the portfolio sorts the generated margin call orders by their unrealized profit and executes each order synchronously until the portfolio is within the margin requirements.</p>
