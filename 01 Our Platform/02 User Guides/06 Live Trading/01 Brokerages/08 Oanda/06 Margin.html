<h4>Buying Power</h4>
<p>The buying power model used by the Oanda brokerage is the <code>SecurityMarginModel</code>, which implements Regulation T rules. Margin accounts can use a leverage of 50.</p>

<h4>Margin Calls</h4>
<p>Regulation T margin rules are enforced with the <code>DefaultMarginCallModel</code>. When the amount of margin remaining in the portfolio drops below 5% of the total portfolio value, a warning is sent. When the amount of margin remaining in the portfolio drops to zero or goes negative, the portfolio sorts the generated margin call orders by their unrealized profit and executes each order synchronously until the portfolio is within the margin requirements.</p>
