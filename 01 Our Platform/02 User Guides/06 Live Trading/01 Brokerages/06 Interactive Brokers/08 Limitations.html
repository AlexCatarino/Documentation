<p>Note the following limitations for the IB brokerage model.</p>

<h4>Plans</h4>
<p>You need an IBKR PRO plan. The IB API does not support the IBKR LITE plan.</p>

<h4>Connections</h4>
<p>You can only have 1 connection at a time to your account. To run more than 1 algorithm, open an IB subaccount for each additional algorithm.</p>

<h4>Feeds</h4>
<p>You need a subscription for each IB data feed that you want to use. Refer to the <a href="../data-feeds#03-Interactive-Brokers-Data-Feeds">Data Feeds documentation</a> for more information.</p>

<h4>ETFs</h4>
<p>EU residents canâ€™t trade ETFs with the IB brokerage because special permission is required.</p>

<h4>API Outages<br></h4>
<p>The IB brokerage model uses the IB API to place live trades. Sometimes the API may be down. Check the <a href="https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/software/systemStatus.php">IB status page</a> to see if the API is currently working.</p>
