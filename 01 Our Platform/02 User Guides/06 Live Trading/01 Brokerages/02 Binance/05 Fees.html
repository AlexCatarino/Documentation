<p>Orders filled with the Binance brokerage are subject to a 0.1% maker and taker fee. Maker fees are paid when you add liquidity to the order book by placing a limit order that doesn't cross the spread. Taker fees are paid when you remove liquidity from the order book by placing an order that crosses the spread.
