<p>Automatic restarts use best efforts to restart your algorithm if it fails due to a runtime error or an API disconnection. Automatic restarts reduce the risk of your algorithm missing a trade during periods of downtime. If you enable automatic restarts when you deploy your algorithm and the algorithm fails while executing, the algorithm will try 5 times to restart. After 5 unsuccessful restarts, the algorithm won't attempt to restart again.</p>
