What are automatic restarts:<div>-When using the deployment GUI, you have the option to enable automatic restarts</div><div>-Automatic restarts use best efforts to restart the algorithm if it fails due to a runtime error. <br></div><div><br></div><div>Why use automatic restarts:</div><div>-This can help improve your algorithm's resilience to temporary outages such as a brokerage API disconnection.</div><div>-To reduce down-time of your strategy if your algorithm runs into an error</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Reduces risk, reduces the chance of missing a trade that your algorithm should've taken</div><div><br></div><div>Limitations:</div><div>-If you enable automatic restarts, the limit is 5 tries. After 5 unsuccessful restarts, the algorithm doesn't attempt to restart again.<br></div><div></div>
