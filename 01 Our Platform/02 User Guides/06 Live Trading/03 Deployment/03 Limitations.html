<p>There are limitations on the number of live trading nodes that your organization can have and the number of brokerage connections that you can have at one time.</p>

<h4>Maximum Number of Nodes</h4>

<p>You need a live trading node for each simultaneous algorithm that you deploy. The tier of your organization determines the number of live trading nodes to which your organization can subscribe. The following number of live trading nodes are available for each tier:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Free</b>: 0</li>
    <li><b>Quant Researcher</b>: 2</li>
    <li><b>Team</b>: 10</li>
    <li><b>Trading Firm</b>: <i>No limit</i></li>
    <li><b>Institution</b>: <i>No limit</i></li>
</ul>

<h4>Brokerage Connections</h4>
<p>You need a brokerage connection or account for each simultaneous algorithm that you deploy. If you want to deploy multiple algorithms using a single brokerage, create subaccounts in your brokerage account so that each algorithm has its own set of brokerage connection credentials. If you log in to your brokerage account while an algorithm is connected to it, the algorithm may stop executing.</p>
