<p>Use the deployment wizard in the Algorithm Lab to deploy your algorithms to live trading. The deployment wizard lets you select a brokerage, enter your brokerage credentials, select a data feed, select a live trading node, set up notifications, and configure automatic algorithm restarts. Most of the brokerages automatically load your cash and position holdings so that your holdings can be viewed on the live performance page. For the brokerages that don't support loading your holdings, you can enter your cash and position holdings in the deployment wizard. After you have deployed your algorithm, you can stop its execution at any time in the web IDE.</p>
