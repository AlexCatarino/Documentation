<p>You provide the URL endpoint and a header JSON object when you set up webhook notifications. Webhook notifications are rate-limited to 20 requests per hour. You can process these notifications on your web server however you want. For instance, you can inject the header information into your server's database or use it to create other notifications on your own server.</p>
