<p>You provide the phone number when you set up SMS notifications. SMS notifications are rate-limited to 20 messages per hour. However, fully utilizing 20 messages per hour costs QuantConnect large expenses. Therefore, we request that you use discretion when sending SMS messages so that we can continue to offer this free service for everyone. SMS notifications are the only type of notification that doesn't require you to have an internet connection to receive the notification. If you manually send an SMS notification, you must provide a message.</p>
