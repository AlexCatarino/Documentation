<p>Note the following limitations of the notification system.</p>

<h4>Backtests</h4>
<p>You can only send notifications in live algorithms. All notifications are ignored in backtesting so that you don't send thousands of notifications when you run a backtest.</p>

<h4>Data Distribution</h4>
<p>You may not distribute data through notifications. We source datasets from external vendors and we must uphold their license terms.</p>

<h4>Brokerage Replacement</h4>
<p>You may not use the notification system to place trades through unsupported brokerages. If your brokerage is not supported by LEAN, <a href="/contact">contact us</a> and weâ€™ll consider integrating your brokerage.</p>
