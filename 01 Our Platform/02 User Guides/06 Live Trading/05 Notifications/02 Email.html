<p>You provide the email address, subject, and body when you set up email notifications. Email notifications are rate-limited to 20 messages per hour. The message body is limited to text content up to 10KB in size. These types of notifications can be slow since they go through your email provider. If you don't receive an email notification that you're expecting, check your junk folders.</p>
