Live quant trading has less stress, less chance of addiction, and less chance of rule-breaking than live discretionary trading because of the automated execution. Deploy your algorithms using QuantConnect because our infrastructure is battle-tested. We have successfully hosted more than 100,000 live algorithms and have had more than $13B in volume traded on our servers since 2015. The algorithms that our members create are run on co-located servers and the trading infrastructure is maintained at all times by our team of engineers. Our LEAN trading engine is also open-source, so you are never prone to vendor lock-in.</p>",
