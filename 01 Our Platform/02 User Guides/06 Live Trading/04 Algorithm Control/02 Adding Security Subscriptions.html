<p>The live performance page enables you to manually create security subscriptions for your algorithm instead of calling <code>Add<i>securityType</i></code> in your code files. The IDE provides fields for each of the arguments that the <code>Add<i>securityType</i></code> method accepts, including the following:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Symbol</li>
    <li>Security type</li>
    <li>Resolution</li>
    <li>Leverage</li>
    <li>Market</li>
    <li>Fill forward</li>
    <li>Extended market hours</li>
</ul>

<p>Add manual security subscriptions to your algorithm so that you can plan manual trades through the web IDE without having to edit and redeploy the algorithm. However, note that you can't manually remove security subscriptions from the web IDE during live execution.</p>
