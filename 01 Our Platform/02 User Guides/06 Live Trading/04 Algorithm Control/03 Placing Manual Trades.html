<p>You can manually place orders from the live performance page instead of using automated methods in your project files. You can use any order type that is supported by the brokerage to which the algorithm is connected. You can even liquidate entire positions without having to specify a specific quantity. Some example situations where it may be helpful to place manual orders instead of stopping and redeploying the algorithm include the following:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Your brokerage account had holdings in it before you deployed your algorithm</li>
    <li>Your algorithm had bugs in it that caused it to purchase the wrong security</li>
    <li>You want to add a hedge to your portfolio without adjusting the algorithm code</li>
    <li>You want to rebalance your portfolio before the rebalance date</li>
</ul>
