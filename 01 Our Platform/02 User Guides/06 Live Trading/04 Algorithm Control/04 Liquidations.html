<p>The live trading performance page has a <b>Liquidate</b> button that acts as a "kill switch" to sell all of the non-equity securities in your portfolio at the current market price using market orders and then stop the algorithm. Liquidate your holdings if you want to immediately stop trading for any reason. For instance, if your algorithm has a bug in it that caused it to purchase a lot of securities that you didn't want, you can liquidate your portfolio instead of tediously placing many manual trades. </p>
