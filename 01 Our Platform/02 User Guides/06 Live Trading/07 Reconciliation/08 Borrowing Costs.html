<p>We do not currently simulate the cost of borrowing shorts in backtests. Therefore, if your algorithm takes short positions, reconciliation can occur. We are working on adding the functionality to model borrowing fees. Subscribe to <a href='https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean/issues/4563'>GitHub Issue #4563</a> to track our progress.</p>
