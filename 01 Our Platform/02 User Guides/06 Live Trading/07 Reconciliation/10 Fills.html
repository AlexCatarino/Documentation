<div><div>In backtesting, orders are filled immediately. In live trading, 
orders are sent to the brokerage. Filling orders through the brokerage 
takes about half a second. Backtest orders that are submitted on stale 
data may have simulated fill prices that are different from the real 
  market price. This commonly happens when creating a 
  <a href="https://www.quantconnect.com/docs/algorithm-reference/scheduled-events">scheduled event</a> with an 
  incompatible data resolution. To avoid this, we recommend using the highest resolution data as much as possible such 
  as minute data, even if you only need hourly bars. This will give you an up to date price feed. <br></div><div><br></div><div>-----<br></div>In
 live trading, Market Orders are executed at whatever price the 
brokerage fills the order at. Backtesting, however, does not know what 
price live orders were filled at and instead models order fills based on
 the best price available according to backtest data.<br><br>Similarly, 
Limit Order fills can differ between out-of-sample backtesting and live 
trading. In backtesting, Limit Orders are filled as soon as the limit 
price is hit. Brokerages, however, might fill the same Limit Order at a 
different price, or fail to fill it, depending on where the order is in 
the order book. </div><div></div>
