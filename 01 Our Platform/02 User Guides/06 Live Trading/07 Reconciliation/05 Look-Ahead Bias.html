<p>We minimize the risk of look-ahead bias in backtests with the <a href="../../../writing-algorithms/user-guides/key-concepts/understanding-time">Time Frontier</a>, but it can still creep into your backtests. For instance, if your algorithm uses a <a href="../../../writing-algorithms/user-guides/custom-datasets/">custom dataset</a> that contains look-ahead bias, reconciliation may occur. To avoid look-ahead bias with custom datasets, set a <code>Period</code> on your custom data points so that the data points are injected into your algorithm after the <code>Time</code> + <code>Period</code>.</p>
