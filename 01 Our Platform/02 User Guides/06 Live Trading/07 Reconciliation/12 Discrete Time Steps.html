<p>Data is injected into your backtests at predictable times according to the data resolution. However, in live trading, data is injected into your algorithm whenever we receive new data. Therefore, if your algorithm has a condition with a specific time (i.e. time is 9:30:15), the condition may work in backtesting but fail in live trading if there is no live data at that point in time. To avoid issues, use a time range in your condition (i.e. 9:30:10 &lt; time &lt; 9:30:20) or use a Scheduled Event.</p>
