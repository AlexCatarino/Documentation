<div>When an algorithm is deployed to a live brokerage account, it will accommodate any current positions that are open, even those unrelated to the algorithm itself. In backtesting, an empty portfolio is assumed. These pre-existing live positions aren't currently reflected in our reconciliation technology, and if they contribute to the live performance of your total portfolio, differences will inevitably exist between the out-of-sample and live curves. </div>
