<p>If you deploy your algorithm to live trading using a brokerage account that has existing holdings, your live trading equity curve will reflect your existing positions. In backtesting, however, your equity curve will not reflect your existing positions. Therefore, if you have existing positions in your brokerage account when you deploy your algorithm to live trading, reconciliation will occur. To avoid issues, deploy your algorithm to live trading using a separate brokerage account or subaccount that does not have existing positions.<br></p>
