<p>Price data is adjusted for splits and dividends by default in backtests. Therefore, if you don't change the data normalization mode, the indicators in your backtests are updated with adjusted price data. In contrast, if a split or dividend occurs in live trading, your indicators will temporarily contain price data from before the corporate event and price data from after the corporate event. If this occurs, your indicators will produce different signals in your backtests compared to your live trading deployment. To avoid issues, reset and warm up your indicators when a corporate event is injected into your algorithm. Refer to the <a href='../../../writing-algorithms/user-guides/indicators/'>Indicators documentation</a> for guidance on resetting and warming up indicators.</p>
