<p>Live trading reconciliation runs an out-of-sample (OSS) backtest in parallel to your live trading deployments. A perfectly reconciled algorithm has an exact overlap between its live and OOS backtest equity curves. Any deviation means that, somehow, the performance of your algorithm has differed between the two execution modes. Several factors can contribute to the deviations. Our goal is to provide you with the best tools to reduce the deviations. This page explains how we can quantify the differences between backtesting and live trading and why the deviations occur.</p>
