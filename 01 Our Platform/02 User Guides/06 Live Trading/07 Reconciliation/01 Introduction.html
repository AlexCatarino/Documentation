<p>Your algorithms will usually perform differently between backtesting and live trading over the same time period. The discrepancy, which is known as reconciliation, occurs because backtests are simulations where we try to model reality as close as possible, but the modeling isn't always perfect. There is always a slight difference in how orders are processed between backtesting and live trading. For instance, slippage, partial fills, and market impact affect the fill prices of your orders in live trading, but they are difficult to accurately model in backtesting. This page explains all of the reasons why reconciliation occurs.</p>
