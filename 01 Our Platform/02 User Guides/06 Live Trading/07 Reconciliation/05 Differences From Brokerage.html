<p>The brokerage that your algorithm uses can cause differences between backtesting and live trading performance.</p>

<h4>Portfolio Allocations on Small Accounts</h4>
<p>If you are trading a small portfolio, it's difficult to achieve accurate portfolio allocations because shares are usually sold in whole numbers. You can achieve accurate portfolio allocations by using fractional shares, but fractional share trading is not supported by all brokerages. To get the closest results when backtesting and live trading over the same period, ensure both algorithms have the same starting cash balance. </p>


<h4>Different Backtest Parameters</h4>
<p>If your backtest and live deployment aren't started on the same date with the same holdings, reconciliation can occur. To avoid issues, ensure your backtest parameters are the same as your live deployment.</p>

<h4>Non-deterministic State From Algorithm Restarts</h4>
<p>If you stop and redeploy your live trading algorithm, it needs to restart in a stateful way, or else reconciliation can occur. To avoid issues, redeploy your algorithm in a stateful way using the <code>SetWarmUp</code> and <code>History</code> methods and use the <code>ObjectStore</code> to save state information between your live trading deployments.</p>


<h4>Existing Portfolio Securities</h4>
<p>If you deploy your algorithm to live trading using a brokerage account that has existing holdings, your live trading equity curve will reflect your existing positions. In backtesting, however, your equity curve will not reflect your existing positions. Therefore, if you have existing positions in your brokerage account when you deploy your algorithm to live trading, reconciliation will occur. To avoid issues, deploy your algorithm to live trading using a separate brokerage account or subaccount that does not have existing positions.<br></p>

<h4>Brokerage Limitations</h4>
<p>We provide brokerage models that support specific order types and model your buying power. In backtesting, your orders are simulated using the brokerage model that you select. However, in live trading, your orders are sent to your brokerage for execution. If the brokerage model that you're using in backtesting is not the same brokerage that you're using in live trading, reconciliation may occur because your live brokerage may not support the order types that you are using and may model your buying power with a different methodology. To avoid brokerage model issues, set the brokerage model in your backtest to the same brokerage that you are using in live trading. Refer to the <a href='brokerages'>Brokerages documentation</a> for guidance on setting the correct brokerage model in your backtests.<br></p>
