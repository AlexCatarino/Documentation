<p>We provide models for predicting fees, slippage, and fills. Although, these model predictions may not always match the fees that your live algorithm actually incurs. You can adjust the reality models that your algorithm uses to more accurrately reflect the specific assets that you are trading. Refer to the  <a href="../../../writing-algorithms/user-guides/reality-modeling/key-concepts">Reality Modelling documentation</a> for guidance on adjusting the models. </p>
