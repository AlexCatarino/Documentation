<p>Dataset providers can experience bugs in their live data feeds that lead to data issues. When live data feed bugs are discovered and reported, our Data Team corrects the invalid data. If the data is corrected after your live algorithm views the original data but before the data is injected into your backtest, you may see a discrepancy between backtesting and live trading performance. If you suspect a data issue may be the cause of your algorithm's reconciliation, check the <a href="https://www.quantconnect.com/data/issues/open"><b>Data Explorer</b></a> page to see if a related data issue is reported or review your order fill prices in backtesting and live trading to see if there are any unrealistic trade prices. It is rare to see an error in the live price, but it is common to miss a split or corporate event in live trading for small companies.</p>
