<div>Custom data is often timestamped at midnight but in reality may not be updated for several days. Ensure the custom 
  data source you are using updates each day by 2-3am ET or your algorithm will not have it available for live trading. <br></div><div><br></div><div>Each day, a backtest is run to generate the out-of-sample curve. If an 
algorithm relies on an external data source, exceptional care must be 
used when coding. External data can be changed, stop being available, or
 received at a different time in live trading than in backtesting. The&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 16px;">out-of-sample&nbsp;</span>backtest
 might not be able to fetch the same data at the same time or frequency 
that it is received in live trading. This can corrupt signals, lead to 
stale data and order placement, or otherwise adversely affect 
performance in some other manner, leading to differences in&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 16px;">out-of-sample&nbsp;</span>and live trading curves.
