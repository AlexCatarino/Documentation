<p>Custom data is often timestamped to midnight, but the data point may not be available in reality until several days after. If your custom dataset is prone to this delay, your backtest may not fetch the same data at the same time or frequency that your live trading algorithm receives the data, causing reconciliation. To avoid issues, ensure the timestamps of your custom dataset are the times of when the data points would be available in reality.</p>
