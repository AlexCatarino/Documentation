<p>We provide brokerage models that support specific order types and model your buying power. In backtesting, your orders are simulated using the brokerage model that you select. However, in live trading, your orders are sent to your brokerage for execution. If the brokerage model that you're using in backtesting is not the same brokerage that you're using in live trading, reconciliation may occur because your live brokerage may not support the order types that you are using and may model your buying power with a different methodology. To avoid brokerage model issues, set the brokerage model in your backtest to the same brokerage that you are using in live trading. Refer to the <a href='brokerages'>Brokerages documentation</a> for guidance on setting the correct brokerage model in your backtests.<br></p>
