<div>When backtesting, 
  <a href="https://www.quantconnect.com/docs/algorithm-framework/universe-selection">universe selection</a> is 
  performed at midnight by default; During live trading, universe selection is done about 6 hours later. This delay 
  can cause the universe to be composed of different securities when switching between the two trading modes. 
  Deploying before the market close should ensure you pick up the universe selection before the market opens. <br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>** TODO: Add:<br></div><div><div>-When you deploy your live trading algorithm after 7am, you'll get 
the same universe for the trading day as if you were to deploy before 
5am. <br></div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Coarse data is updated once per day</div><div></div>
