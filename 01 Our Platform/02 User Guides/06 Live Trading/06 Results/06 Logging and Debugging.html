<p>The live performance page has a <span class='tab-name'>Logs</span> tab that displays all of the logs, debug messages, and status messages that your algorithm creates. It's good practice to add logs in a live deployment because then you can see what is happening during execution. The status messages include all of the points in time when your algorithm deployed, encountered an error, sent an order, or quit execution. You can view the logs directly in the <span class='tab-name'>Logs</span> tab or download them for further analysis. If you stop and redeploy your algorithm, the logs are retained. <br></p>
