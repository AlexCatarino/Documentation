<ul>
    <li><b>Equity</b>: The live equity curve of your algorithm.</li>
    <li><b>Out of Sample Backtest</b>: The backtest equity curve of your algorithm during the live trading period.</li>
    <li><b>Meta</b>: Points in time when you stopped your algorithm, redeployed your algorithm, or your algorithm encountered a runtime error.</li>
