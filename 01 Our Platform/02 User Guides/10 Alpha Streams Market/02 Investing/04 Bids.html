<p>Bids are offers from investors to license Alpha allocations at a specific price for a period of 1-3 months. The default minimum bid price is $3/allocation but Authors can set a custom reserve price that you must bid. Bids work the same as limit orders when buying securities. You can <a href="/docs/v2/our-platform/tutorials/alpha-streams-market/licensing-alphas#04-Place-New-Bids">create</a>, <a href="/docs/v2/our-platform/tutorials/alpha-streams-market/licensing-alphas#05-Manage-Existing-Bids">update, and cancel bids</a> at any time. If you place a bid when an Alpha has lots available, your bid is automatically accepted. If there are no lots available when you place your bid, your bid stays on the Alpha order book until you are granted a subscription or you cancel your bid. Your bids can be accepted immediately or when the monthly auction occurs. Your bids automatically renew, but you can cancel them at any time.</p>

<p>where <span class='latex-variable'>a</span> is the maximum amount of capital that you want to allocate to the Alpha, <span class='latex-variable'>c</span> is the lot size of the Alpha ($10,000), <span class='latex-variable'>b</span> is your bid price, <span class='latex-variable'>n</span> is the number of months to license to the Alpha, <span class='latex-variable'>f<sub>qc</sub></span> is the 30% QuantConnect market fee, and the <span class='latex-variable'>f<sub>d</sub></span> is the subscription fee of the datasets that the Alpha uses. For example, if you want to allocate $100,000 to an Alpha, you want to bid $3, you want to license the Alpha for three months, and the Alpha only uses free datasets, then the total cost of licensing the Alpha is</p>
