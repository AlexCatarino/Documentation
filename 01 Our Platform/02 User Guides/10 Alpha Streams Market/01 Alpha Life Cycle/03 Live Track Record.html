<p>We deploy the Alphas that are accepted into the Alpha Streams Market to paper trading in order to produce the live trading results on the <a href="/docs/v2/our-platform/user-guides/alpha-streams-market/alpha-listings">Alpha listing</a> page. The live trading results are simulated using the <code>AlphaStreamsBrokerageModel</code>, so you may experience slightly different results when you deploy the Alpha using a real brokerage. We do not allocate capital to Alphas without <a href="/docs/v2/our-platform/user-guides/alpha-streams-market/investing">licensing the Alpha</a> and paying the Author like every other Licensee.</p>
