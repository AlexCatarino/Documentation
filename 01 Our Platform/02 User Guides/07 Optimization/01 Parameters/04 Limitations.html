<p>There are limits on the number of concurrent backtests that the optimizer can run and the number of parameters that can be optimized.</p>

<h4>Number of Concurrent Backtests</h4>
<p>The optimizer can run up to 24 concurrent backtests.</p>

<h4>Number of Parameters</h4>
<p>The cloud optimizer currently only supports optimizing up to 2 parameters. The number of parameters is limited because grid search is the only supported optimization strategy and, since grid search tests all of the parameter combinations, optimizing more than 2 parameters requires too many backtests. When the optimizer has more efficient optimization strategies, we can alleviate this limitation. To optimize more parameters before we add more optimization strategies, use the <a href="../../../lean-cli/api-reference/lean-optimize">CLI</a>.</p>
