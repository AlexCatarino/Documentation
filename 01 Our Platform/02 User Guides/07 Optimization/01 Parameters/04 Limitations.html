<div>What are the limitations:</div><div>-Only 1-2 parameters can be optimized (only in the cloud, you can run more in LEAN or LEAN CLI)<br></div><div>-up to 24 optimization nodes can run concurrently<br></div><div><br></div><div>Why:</div><div>-1-2 parameter limit because the result window because it's difficult to visualize the results of optimizing 3+ parameters and their impact on the objective function (4+ dimensional plots would be needed)</div><div></div>
