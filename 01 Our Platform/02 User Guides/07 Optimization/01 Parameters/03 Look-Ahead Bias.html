<p>Look-ahead bias occurs when you make decisions in the present using information that would not be available until some time into the future. A common example of look-ahead bias is selecting a universe of securities for your backtest based on the performance of the securities during the backtesting period. Another example of look-ahead bias is selecting indicators and indicator values for your backtest based on the performance of those indicators during the backtesting period. To reduce the risk of look-ahead bias, build and optimize your algorithm on in-sample data and then compare the performance of the algorithm on the in-sample period and an out-of-sample period.</p>
