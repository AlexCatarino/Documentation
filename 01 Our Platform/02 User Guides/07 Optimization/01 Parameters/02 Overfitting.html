<p>Overfitting occurs when a function is too closely fit to a limited set of training data. Overfitting can occur in your trading algorithms if you have many parameters or select parameters values that are that worked very well in the past but are sensitive to small changes in their values. In these cases, your algorithm will likely be fine-tuned to fit the detail and noise of backtesting data to the extent that it negatively impacts the performance of your algorithm on new data. An algorithm that is dynamic and generalizes to new data is more valuable to funds and individual investors. Such an algorithm is more likely to survive across different market conditions and apply to new asset classes and markets.</p>
