  "content" : "<p>Parameter optimization is the process of finding the optimal algorithm parameters to maximize or minimize an objective function. For instance, you can optimize your indicator parameters to maximize the Sharpe ratio that your algorithm achieves over a backtest. Optimization can help you adjust your strategy to achieve better backtesting performance, but be wary of overfitting. If you select parameter values that model the past too closely, your algorithm may not be robust enough to perform well using out-of-sample data.</p>",
