<p>You must run a backtest of your algorithm before the deployment wizard can calculate the cost of the optimization job. The optimization nodes are rented on a time basis, so using the results of the last successful backtest of your algorithm, the number of parameters, and the optimization strategy, we can estimate the total cost of the optimization job. However, the final cost that you pay can vary. If the parameters that were used in the last backtest were favorable for speedy execution, the estimate can be lower than the final cost. <br></p> 

<p>You can use multiple nodes to speed up the optimization job without the job costing more because each of the nodes are used for a shorter period of time. However, note that there is a spin-up time of roughly 15 seconds on each backtest, so it can sometimes cost more to use many nodes when you factor in the spin-up time. You pay for optimizations with the QuantConnect Credit balance of your organization. If you have your own hardware, you can run local optimizations with your own data and hardware.</p>
