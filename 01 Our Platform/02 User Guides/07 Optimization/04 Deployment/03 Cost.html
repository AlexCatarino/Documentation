<p>Optimization nodes are rented on a time basis. The deployment wizard estimates the total cost of your optimization job based on the results of the last successful backtest of your algorithm, the number of <a href="parameters">parameters</a>, and the <a href="strategies">optimization strategy</a>. Therefore, you must <a href="../../tutorials/backtesting/managing-backtests#03-Run-Backtests">run a backtest</a> of your algorithm before the deployment wizard can estimate the cost of the optimization job. The final cost that you pay can vary from the estimate. For instance, if your backtest used parameters that were favorable for speedy execution, the estimate can be lower than the final cost. <br></p> 

<p>You can use multiple nodes to speed up the optimization job without the job costing more because you use each node for a shorter period of time. However, there is a spin-up time of roughly 15 seconds on each backtest, so it can sometimes cost more to use many nodes when you factor in the spin-up time. You pay for optimizations with your organization's <a href="../organizations/credit">QuantConnect Credit</a> balance. If you have your own hardware, you can <a href="../../../lean-cli/tutorials/optimization/local-optimizations">run local optimizations</a> with your own data and hardware.</p>
