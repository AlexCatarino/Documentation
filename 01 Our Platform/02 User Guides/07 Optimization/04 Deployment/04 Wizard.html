<p>The optimization wizard is a GUI in the IDE where you can select the optimization parameters, objectives, strategy, constraints, and nodes. Follow the point-and-click process of the wizard to launch optimizations jobs in the same location where you perform research and write algorithms. After you launch an optimization job, the optimization results page automatically displays and is updated in real-time as the optimization nodes backtest your algorithm.</p>
