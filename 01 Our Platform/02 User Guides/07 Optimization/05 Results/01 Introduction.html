<p>The optimization results page displays the results of the backtests within your optimization jobs. The results page displays the equity curve and the value of the objective function from each backtest that the optimization runs. View the optimization results page to see how the changes in parameter values affect the performance of your algorithm, to see how sensitive the parameters are to changes, and to take a closer look at the individual backtests that are run.</p>
