<p>There are limitations of the optimizer when your backtests throw a runtime error or produce too much data.</p>

<h4>Runtime Errors</h4>
<p>If a backtest in your optimization job throws a runtime error, the backtest will not complete but your organization's QuantConnect Credit will still be consumed.</p>

<h4>Data Overload</h4>
<p>If a backtest in your optimization job produces more than 700MB of data, then Lean can't upload the results and the optimization job appears to never be complete.</p>
