<p>There are limitations of the optimizer when your backtests throw a run-time error or produce too much data.</p>

<h4>Run-time Errors</h4>
<p>If a backtest in your optimization job throws a run-time error, the backtest will not complete but you will still be charged.</p>

<h4>Data Overload</h4>
<p>If a backtest in your optimization job produces too much data (> 700MB), then Lean is not capable of uploading the results and the optimization job appears to never complete.</p>
