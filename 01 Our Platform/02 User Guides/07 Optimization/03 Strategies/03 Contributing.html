<p>We encourage you to contribute optimization strategies to the <a href="https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean">Lean open-source project</a>. You can contribute any strategy that is popular in the literature and is not already implemented. Refer to <a href="https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean/tree/master/Optimizer/Strategies">our GitHub repository</a> to view which optimization strategies are already implemented. If you contribute a strategy, you'll receive some <a href='../organizations/administration#03-Credit'>QuantConnect Credit</a>, you'll be shown as a contributor to Lean on your GitHub profile, and your work will be used in the Algorithm Lab by our community of over 160,000 quants.</p>
