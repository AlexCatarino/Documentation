<p>Grid search is the most complete but the most expensive strategy because it takes a brute force approach and tests all the combinations of parameter values. If you are optimizing one parameter, the grid search strategy selects the values of the parameters based on the starting value, ending value, and step size that you specify. If you are optimizing two parameters, the grid search strategy searches the cartesian product of possible values for each parameter. The benefit of the grid search strategy is that it is the most comprehensive optimization strategy. The drawback of the strategy is it can be an expensive option because of the curse of dimensionality.</p>
