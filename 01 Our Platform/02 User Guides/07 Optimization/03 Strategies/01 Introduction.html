<p>Optimization strategies control how parameters are adjusted for each new backtest run by the optimizer. The strategies adjust the parameter values based on the value of the objective function from earlier backtests. We currently have support for the grid search strategy, but you can contribute a new optimization strategy to the Lean GitHub repository.<br></p>
