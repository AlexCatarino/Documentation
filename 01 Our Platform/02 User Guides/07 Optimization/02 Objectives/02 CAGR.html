<p>where <i>s</i> is starting equity, <i>e</i> is ending equity, and <i>y</i> is the number of years in the backtesting period. The benefit of using CAGR as the objective is that it maximizes the return of your algorithm over the entire backtest. The drawback of using CAGR is that it may cause your algorithm to have more volatile returns, making it more difficult to keep your algorithm deployed in live mode. Furthermore, if a lot of traders are optimizing for CAGR, your algorithm may correlate with the algorithms of other traders who also optimize for CAGR.</p>
