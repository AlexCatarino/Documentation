<p>where <span class='latex-variable'>s</span> is starting equity, <span class='latex-variable'>e</span> is ending equity, and <span class='latex-variable'>y</span> is the number of years in the backtest period. The benefit of using CAGR as the objective is that it maximizes the return of your algorithm over the entire backtest. The drawback of using CAGR is that it may cause your algorithm to have more volatile returns, which increases the difficultly of keeping your algorithm deployed in live mode. Furthermore, if a lot of other market participants optimize for CAGR, your algorithm may correlate with their algorithms.</p>
