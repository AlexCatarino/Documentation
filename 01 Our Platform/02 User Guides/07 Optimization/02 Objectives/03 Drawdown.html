<p>Drawdown is the largest peak to trough decline in your algorithm's equity curve. Drawdown is calculated as</p>

<p><i>Note.</i> This figure illustrates how the max drawdown of an equity curve is calculated. During the first highlighted period, the equity curve dropped from $106,027 to $93,949 (11.4%). During the second highlighted period, the equity curve dropped from $112,848 to $99,576 (11.8%). Since 11.8% > 11.4%, the max drawdown of the equity curve is 11.8%.</p>

<p>The benefit of using drawdown as the objective is that it is easier to keep an algorithm deployed in live mode if the algorithm doesn't experience large drawdowns. The drawback of using drawdown is that it may limit the potential returns of your algorithm.</p>
