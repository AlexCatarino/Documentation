<p>An optimization objective is a performance metric that's used to quantify and compare the backtest performance of different parameter values. The optimizer currently supports the compound annual growth rate (CAGR), drawdown, Sharpe ratio, and Probabalistic Sharpe ratio (PSR) as optimization objectives. These objectives can be minimized or maximized as the optimization runs. When the optimization job finishes, the results page displays the the value of the objective with respect to the parameter values selected by the optimizer.</p>
