<p>You need an idle backtesting node in your organization to deploy a backtest. Backtesting nodes that are more powerful can run faster backtests and backtest nodes with more RAM can handle more memory-intensive operations like training machine learning models, processing Options data, and managing large universes. The following table shows the specifications of the backtesting node models:</p>

<p>Refer to the <a href=/pricing"><b>Pricing</b></a> page to see the price of each backtesting node model. The first organization on each account is given one free B-MICRO backtesting node. This node incurs a 20-second delay when you launch backtests, but the delay is removed and the node is replaced when your organization subscribes to a new backtesting node.<br></p>
