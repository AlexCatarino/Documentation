<p>You need multiple backtesting nodes to run multiple backtests at the same time in your organization. The more backtesting nodes your organization has, the more concurrent backtests you can execute to speed up your strategy development. If you just need to adjust parameters between backtests, consider running a parameter optimization. With parameter optimization, you can run multiple backtests concurrently without needing to have multiple backtest nodes.<br></p>
