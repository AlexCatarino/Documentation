<p>Concurrent backtesting is running multiple backtests at the same time within a single organization. Concurrent backtesting speeds up your strategy development because you don't have to wait while a single backtest finishes exeucting. You need multiple backtesting nodes in your organization to run concurrent backtests. The more backtesting nodes that your organization has, the more concurrent backtests you can execute. If you just need to adjust parameters between backtests, consider running a <a href="../optimization">parameter optimization</a>. If you run a parameter optimization job, you can run multiple backtests concurrently without having multiple backtest nodes.<br></p>
