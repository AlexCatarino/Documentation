<div>What are backtesting biases:</div><div>&nbsp; - Mistakes that can make backtest results look very good but the results won't continue into live trading</div><div><br></div><div>Why are there biases:</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp; - They are a result of the nature of backtesting</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Naive researching / unexperienced</div><div><br></div><div>What's the result of backtesting with these biases:</div><div><div>&nbsp; - There is an opportunity cost of researching/deploying strategies with the following biases (lost time)<br></div>&nbsp; - They may cost you money in live trading<br></div><div><br></div><div>----------------------<br></div><div>&lt;h4&gt;Overfitting</div>What is overfitting:<div><div>-Modeling to closely to the past</div><div>-Selecting parameters that work extremely well in the past</div><div>-parameters are fine-tuned to fit the detail and noise of backtesting data to the extent
 that it negatively impacts the performance of the algorithm on new data</div><div><br></div><div>Why is overfitting a problem:</div><div>-
 If you create a trading model that's modeled too closely to the past, 
it may not be robust enough to work in live trading / out of sample</div><div>-  negatively impacts the algorithm's ability to generalize and trade well in all market conditions</div><div>- An algorithm that is dynamic and generalizes to new data is more 
valuable to funds and individual investors. It is more likely to survive
 across different market conditions and apply to new asset classes and 
markets.
</div><div><br></div><div>Why does overfitting occur:</div>- From over-optimizing <br></div><div>- Having too many algorithm parameters</div><div><br></div><div>----------------------</div><div>&lt;h4&gt;Lookahead bias</div><div><div>What is look-ahead bias<br></div><div>-Using information in the future to make decisions in the present</div><div><br></div><div>Why is look-ahead bias a risk:</div><div>-Selecting a universe of securities that have performed well in recent history</div><div>-Selecting indicators and indicator values that have performed well in recent history</div>-By running multiple optimizations/backtests, you incorporate results of past tests into the new tests</div><div>- Avoided to some extent by using the backtesting environment since it's event driven and you can't pass the time frontier</div><div>- To avoid: It's best to use a dynamic universe instead of selecting a manual
 universe with securities that you know have performed well</div><div><br></div><div>----------------------</div><div>&lt;h4&gt;Survivorship bias</div><div>What is survivorship bias:</div><div>-Testing a strategy only on securities that have made it, omitting securities that have been delisted<br></div><div><br></div><div>Why is survivorship bias an issue:</div><div>-In
 some trading platforms it's an issue because your strategy will have 
inflated performance in history, only being tested on securities that 
have proven to be successful<br></div><div>-Survivorship bias is not an issue since our datasets are free of survivorship bias</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Even if a security was delisted, it's included in backtest simulations</div>
