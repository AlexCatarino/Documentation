<p>The content in the backtest results page is updated as the backtest executes. You can close or refresh the window without interrupting the backtesting node because the node is processing on our servers. Only you can view your backtest results unless you explicitly make the backtest publish and share the results. The backtest results page has a table at the bottom of the page with the following tabs:<br></p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Overview</b>: Various statistics on the backtest performance <br></li>
    <li><b>Report</b>: Create a backtest report</li>
    <li><b>Orders</b>: A table of orders that occurred in the backtest. <br></li>
    <li><b>Logs</b>: The logs generated through the backtesting, including error messages, debug statements, quit statements.<br></li>
    <li><b>Code</b>: The project files used to deploy the backtest. <br></li>
    <li><b>Share</b>: Make the backtest publish and generate links to share the results.<br></li>
</ul>

<p>Backtests result files are given an arbitrary name when the backtest is deployed. However, you can rename the backtest result files using the IDE. Backtest results are archived after 12 months of inactivity or immediately on deletion. If you share a backtest result, it's public domain and always stored.<br></p>
