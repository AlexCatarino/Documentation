<p>The content in the backtest results page is updated as your backtest executes. You can close or refresh the window without interrupting the backtesting node because the node is processing on our servers. Only you can view your backtest results unless you explicitly make the backtest public and share the results. The table at the bottom of the backtest results page has the following tabs:<br></p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Overview</b>: Various statistics on the backtest performance.<br></li>
    <li><b>Report</b>: Create a <a href="../report/backtesting">backtest report</a>.</li>
    <li><b>Orders</b>: A table of orders that occurred in the backtest. <br></li>
    <li><b>Logs</b>: The logs generated through the backtesting, including error messages, debug statements, quit statements.<br></li>
    <li><b>Code</b>: The project files that were used to deploy the backtest. <br></li>
    <li><b>Share</b>: <a href="../..tutorials/backtesting/managing-backtests#09-Share-Backtests">Make the backtest public</a> and generate links to share the results.<br></li>
</ul>

<p>We give an arbitrary name (for example, "Smooth Apricot Chicken") to your backtest result files, but you can <a href='../../tutorials/backtesting/managing-backtests#06-Rename-Backtests'>rename them</a>. If you <a href='../../tutorials/backtesting/managing-backtests#08-Delete-Backtests'>delete a backtest result</a> or you are inactive for 12 months, we archive your backtest results. If you share a backtest result, it's public domain and always stored.<br></p>
