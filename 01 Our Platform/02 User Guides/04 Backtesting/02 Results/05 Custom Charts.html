<div>What are custom charts:</div><div>-Line charts and scatter plots that you create while your algorithm is executing</div><div>-Custom candle plots are not supported</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -This is a charting limitation that we hope to address in the future. 
Meanwhile, we can save the data in ObjectStore and load it in the 
Research Environment where there are charting packages that can help us 
achieve the desired view.</div><div><br></div><div>What are example applications:<br></div><div><div>- You can chart variable values over time</div><div>- Useful if you hit your logging limits</div></div><div><br></div><div>What customizations are supported:<br></div><div>-Can customize color &amp; shapes</div><div><br></div><div>What are the limitations:<br></div><div><div>- we limit the number of points a chart can have to 4000</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - because intensive charting generates hundreds of megabytes (200MB) of data</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - far too much to stream online or display in a web browser</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - you see the error <code>Exceeded maximum points per chart, data skipped</code></div><div>- Refer to the Charting docs (link) for more info [since this will take a full page]</div></div><div>
