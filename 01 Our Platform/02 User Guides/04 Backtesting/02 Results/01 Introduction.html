<p>When you deploy a backtest, the backtest results page automatically displays. The backtest results page presents the equity curve, trades, trades, logs, performance statistics, and much more information. Review the backtest results page to see how your algorithm performed during the backtest and to investigate how you might improve your algorithm. When you're ready to share your results, you can share the project files and create a performance report on the backtest results page.<br></p>
