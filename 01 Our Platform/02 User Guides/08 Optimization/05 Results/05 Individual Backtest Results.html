<p>The optimization results page displays a Backtests table that includes all of the backtests that ran during the optimization job.</p>

<p>The table lists the parameter values of the backtest and the resulting value of the objectives. You can <a href="/docs/v2/our-platform/tutorials/optimization/reviewing-results#04-Adjust-Performance-Table">manipulate the table</a> by applying filters and sorting by a column. To perform deeper analysis into the individual backtests run by the optimizer, <a href="/docs/v2/our-platform/tutorials/optimization/reviewing-results#06-View-Individual-Backtests">open the individual backtest results</a> or <a href="/docs/v2/our-platform/tutorials/optimization/reviewing-results#05-Download-Results">download the table</a>.</p>
