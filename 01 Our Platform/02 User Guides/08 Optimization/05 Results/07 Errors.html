<p>Errors can arise when optimizing parameters.</p>

<h4>Runtime Errors</h4>
<p>If a backtest in your optimization job throws a runtime error, the backtest will not complete but you will still be charged.</p>

<h4>Data Overload</h4>
<p>If a backtest in your optimization job produces more than 700MB of data, then Lean is not capable of uploading the results and the optimization job appears to never be complete.</p>
