<p>There are limits on the number of concurrent backtests that the optimizer can run and the number of parameters that can be optimized.</p>

<h4>Number of Concurrent Backtests</h4>
<p>The optimizer can run up to 24 concurrent backtests.</p>

<h4>Number of Parameters</h4>
<p>The cloud optimizer currently only supports optimizing up to two parameters. The number of parameters is limited because grid search is the only supported optimization strategy and, since grid search tests all of the parameter combinations, optimizing more than two parameters requires too many backtests. When the optimizer has more efficient optimization strategies, we can alleviate this limitation. To optimize more parameters before we add more optimization strategies, use the <a href="/docs/v2/lean-cli/api-reference/lean-optimize">CLI</a>.</p>
