<div>What happens when I optimize:</div><div>-The optimizer runs concurrent backtests with your code files</div><div>-The hardware nodes that the optimizer uses aren't the hardware nodes in your organization</div><div>-You can select how many nodes to use (between 1 and 24) when optimizing</div><div>-There are different types of nodes to select for the optimization, each has different specs</div><div>-As the optimization runs, the results are presented and updated in real-time</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>&lt;h3&gt;Cost</div><div>What is the cost:</div><div>-Optimization is paid for in QCC from your organization</div><div>-The cost is calculated after you run a backtest for the strategy</div><div>-Using the last run backtest, the optimization search model selected and 
the number
                 of parameters, QuantConnect can create a rough estimate
 of the total time it will take to run this optimization. 
                 You can speed up this optimization by assigning it more
 processing nodes, or depending on your
                  algorithm making sure it has sufficient CPU available.
 Note: There is a spin up time of roughly
                   15s on each backtest so even very short backtests can
 sometimes take some time to process.</div><div>-Optimization nodes are rented on a time-basis<br></div><div>
