<p>The following key statistics are included at the top of the backtest report to summarize your algorithm's backtest performance:</p>

<ul>
    <li><span class='ul-option'>Days Live</span>: The number of days in the backtest.</li>
    <li><span class='ul-option'>Turnover</span>: The percentage of the algorithm's portfolio that was replaced in a given year.</li>
    <li><span class='ul-option'>CAGR</span>: The <a href='../optimization/objectives#02-CAGR'>cumulative annual growth rate</a> of the backtest.</li>
    <li><span class='ul-option'>Markets</span>: The asset classes that the algorithm trades.</li>
    <li><span class='ul-option'>Trades per day</span>: The total number of trades during the backtest divided by the number of days in the backtest. Trades per day is an approximation of the algorithm's trading frequency.</li>
    <li><span class='ul-option'>Drawdown</span>: The largest peak to trough decline in the algorithm's equity curve during the backtest.</li>
    <li><span class='ul-option'>PSR</span>: The <a href='../optimization/objectives#05-PSR'>Probabilistic Sharpe Ratio</a> of the backtest.</li>
    <li><span class='ul-option'>Sharpe Ratio</span>: The Sharpe Ratio of the backtest.</li>
    <li><span class='ul-option'>Information Ratio</span>: The Information Ratio of the backtest.</li>
    <li><span class='ul-option'>Strategy Capacity</span>: The maximum amount of money that the algorithm can trade (denominated in USD) before its performance degrades from market impact.</li>
</ul>
