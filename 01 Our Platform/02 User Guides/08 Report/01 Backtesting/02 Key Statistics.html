<p>The following key statistics are included at the top of the backtest report to summarize your algorithm's backtest performance:</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Days Live</b>: The number of days in the backtest.</li>
    <li><b>Turnover</b>: The percentage of the algorithm's portfolio that was replaced in a given year.</li>
    <li><b>CAGR</b>: The <a href='../optimization/objectives#02-CAGR'>cumulative annual growth rate</a> of the backtest.</li>
    <li><b>Markets</b>: The asset classes that the algorithm trades.</li>
    <li><b>Trades per day</b>: The total number of trades during the backtest divided by the number of days in the backtest. Trades per day is an approximation of the algorithm's trading frequency.</li>
    <li><b>Drawdown</b>: The largest peak to trough decline in the algorithm's equity curve during the backtest.</li>
    <li><b>PSR</b>: The <a href='../optimization/objectives#05-PSR'>Probabilistic Sharpe Ratio</a> of the backtest.</li>
    <li><b>Sharpe Ratio</b>: The Sharpe Ratio of the backtest.</li>
    <li><b>Information Ratio</b>: The Information Ratio of the backtest.</li>
    <li><b>Strategy Capacity</b>: The maximum amount of money that the algorithm can trade (denominated in USD) before its performance degrades from market impact.</li>
</ul>
