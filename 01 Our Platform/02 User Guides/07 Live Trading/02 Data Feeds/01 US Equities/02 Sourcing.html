<p>The US Equities data feed consolidates market data across all of the exchanges. Over-the-Counter (OTC) trades are excluded. The data feed is powered by the Securities Information Processor (SIP), so it has 100% market coverage. In contrast, free platforms that display data feeds like the Better Alternative Trading System (BATS) only have about 25% market coverage.</p>

<p>We provide live splits, dividends, and corporate actions for US companies. They are delivered to your algorithm before the next trading day.</p>
