<p>Our US Equities data feed consolidates market data across all of the exchanges. You can use our US Equities data feed to trade through our <a href="/docs/v2/our-platform/user-guides/live-trading/brokerages">supported brokerages</a>. Our data feed is powered by the Securities Information Processor (SIP), so it has 100% market coverage. In contrast, free platforms that display data feeds like the Better Alternative Trading System (BATS) only have about 25% market coverage.</p>
