<p>Tick price data is raw and unfiltered, so it can contain a lot of noise. If a tick is not tradable, we flag it as suspicious. This process makes the bars a more realistic representation of what you could execute in live trading. If you use tick data, avoid using suspicious ticks in your algorithms as informative data points. We recommend only using tick data if you understand the risks and are able to perform your own tick filtering. Ticks are flagged as suspicious in the following situations:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The tick occurs below the best bid or above the best ask</li>

    <p>This image shows a tick that occurred above the best ask price of a security. The green line represents the best ask of the security, the blue line represents the best bid of the security, and the red dots represent trade ticks. The ticks between the best bid and ask occur from filling hidden orders. The tick that occurred above the best ask price is flagged as suspicious.</p>
    <li>The tick occurs far from the current market price</li>
