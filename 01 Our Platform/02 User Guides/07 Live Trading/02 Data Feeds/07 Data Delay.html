<p>We run your live trading algorithms on co-located servers racked in Equinix. If you <a href="/docs/v2/our-platform/tutorials/live-trading/brokerages">run your algorithms on co-located servers</a>, your algorithm receives market data faster than if you were to deploy the algorithm on a different computer. If you send a market order to your brokerage from our co-located servers, the order takes about half a second to fill. Therefore, your trading strategies can't be ultra-high-frequency, but you can reliably deploy fast intraday strategies. In addition to faster execution and order fills, co-location also reduces several factors that can interfere with your algorithm, including downtime from internet outages, equipment repairs, and natural disasters. </p>
