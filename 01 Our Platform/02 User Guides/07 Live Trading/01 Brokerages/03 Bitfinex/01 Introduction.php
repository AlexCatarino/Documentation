<p>Bitfinex was founded by Giancarlo Devasini and Raphael Nicolle in 2012 with the goal to "give our users the ultimate cryptocurrency trading experience"<sup><a href="https://www.bitfinex.com/about/">1</a></sup>. Bitfinex provides access to trading Crypto for clients outside prohibited jurisdictions<sup><a href="https://www.bitfinex.com/legal/exchange/terms">2</a></sup> with no minimum deposit to set up an account. If you fund your account with fiat currency, they enforce a 10,000 minimum for USD, EUR, and GBP<sup><a href="https://support.bitfinex.com/hc/en-us/articles/360023357574-Bank-Wire-Deposit-">3</a></sup>. However, if you fund your account with Crypto, they do not enforce a minimum deposit. Bitfinex also provides Crypto staking, a mobile app, and an unrealized profit leaderboard for the traders on the platform. Bitfinex has always been at the forefront of technological innovation in digital asset trading.</p>
