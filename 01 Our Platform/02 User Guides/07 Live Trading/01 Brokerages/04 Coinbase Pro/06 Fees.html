<p>Check the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://help.coinbase.com/en/pro/trading-and-funding/trading-rules-and-fees/fees">What are the fees on Coinbase Pro?</a> page on the Coinbase Pro website to see the live trading order fees. In backtests, we model the fees by charging maker and taker fees. If you add liquidity to the order book by placing a limit order that doesn't cross the spread, you pay maker fees. If you remove liquidity from the order book by placing an order that crosses the spread, you pay taker fees. Before 2019/3/23 1:30am UTC, we charge a 0% maker fee and a 0.3% taker fee. After 2019/3/23 1:30am UTC, we charge a 0.15% maker fee and a 0.25% taker fee. We don't currently model your 30-day trading volume to adjust the fees in backtests. In live trading, Coinbase Pro adjusts the fees.</p>
