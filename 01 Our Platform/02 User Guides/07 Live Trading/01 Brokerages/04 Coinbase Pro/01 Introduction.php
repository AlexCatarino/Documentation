<p>Coinbase was founded by Brian Armstrong and Fred Ehrsam in 2012 with the goal to "increase economic freedom in the world"<sup><a href="https://www.coinbase.com/mission">1</a></sup>. Coinbase Pro provides access to trading Crypto for clients in over 100 countries<sup><a href="https://www.coinbase.com/places">2</a></sup> with no minimum deposit. Coinbase Pro also provides a self-hosted Crypto wallet, a Visa debit rewards card, and Bitcoin collateral-backed lines of credit. The former name of the Coinbase Exchange was Global Digital Asset Exchange (GDAX), so the <code>GDAXBrokerageModel</code> connects to the Coinbase Pro brokerage in live trading and simulates order fills in backtesting.</p>
