<p>Coinbase was founded by Brian Armstrong and Fred Ehrsam in 2012 with the goal to "increase economic freedom in the world". Coinbase Pro provides access to trading Crypto for clients in over <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/places">100 countries</a> with no minimum deposit. Coinbase Pro also provides a self-hosted Crypto wallet, a Visa debit rewards card, and Bitcoin collateral-backed lines of credit. The former name of the Coinbase Exchange was Global Digital Asset Exchange (GDAX), so the <code>GDAXBrokerageModel</code> connects to the Coinbase Pro brokerage in live trading and simulates order fills in backtesting.</p>
