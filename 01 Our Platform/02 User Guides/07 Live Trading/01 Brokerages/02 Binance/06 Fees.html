<p>Check the <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/fee/schedule">Trading Fees</a> page on the Binance.com website or the <a href="https://www.binance.us/en/fee/schedule">Fee Structure</a> page on the Binance.us website to see the live trading order fees. In backtests, the fees are modeled with the <code>BinanceFeeModel</code>, which charges a 0.1% maker and taker fee. If you add liquidity to the order book by placing a limit order that doesn't cross the spread, you pay maker fees. If you remove liquidity from the order book by placing an order that crosses the spread, you pay taker fees. The <code>BinanceFeeModel</code> does not currently model your 30-day trading volume and BNB balance to adjust the fees in backtests. In live trading, Binance adjusts the fees.</p>
