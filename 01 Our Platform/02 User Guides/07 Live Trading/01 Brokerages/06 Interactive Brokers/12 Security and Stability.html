<p>Note the following limitations of the IB API.</p>

<h4>Connections</h4>
<p>IB only supports 1 connection at a time to your account. To run more than 1 algorithm, open an IB subaccount for each additional algorithm.</p>


<h4>API Outages<br></h4>
<p>We call the IB API to place live trades. Sometimes the API may be down. Check the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/software/systemStatus.php">IB status page</a> to see if the API is currently working.</p>

<h4>SMS 2FA</h4>
<p>Our IB integration doesn't support Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) via SMS. Use the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://guides.interactivebrokers.com/iphone/log_in/using_ios.htm">IB Key protocol in IBKR Mobile</a> instead.</p>

<h4>System Resets</h4>
<p>If your IB account has 2FA enabled, you'll need to re-authenticate once a week. The reset schedule is available on the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/software/systemStatus.php">IB Status page</a>. If you miss the timeout period, your algorithm quits executing.</p>
