<p>The <code>InteractiveBrokersBrokerageModel</code> models buying power and margin calls to ensure your algorithm stays within the margin requirements.</p>

<h4>Buying Power</h4>
<p>The <code>InteractiveBrokersBrokerageModel</code> uses the <code>CashBuyingPowerModel</code> for cash accounts. For margin accounts, the buying power model that's used and the amount of leverage that's available depends on the type of security that you're trading. The following table shows the buying power model that is used and the amount of leverage that's available for each security type when you're using a margin account:<br></p>

<table class="table qc-table" id="buying-power-table">
   <thead>
      <tr>
         <th>Security Type<br></th>
         <th>Buying Power Model<br></th>
         <th>Leverage</th>
      </tr>
   </thead>
   <tbody>
      <tr>
         <td>Equity</td>
         <td><code>SecurityMarginModel</code></td>

      <tr>

      </tr>
      <tr>
         <td>Future Options</td>
         <td><code>FuturesOptionsMarginModel</code></td>
         <td>1</td>

<h4>Margin Calls</h4>
<p>Regulation T margin rules are enforced with the <code>DefaultMarginCallModel</code>. When the amount of margin remaining in your portfolio drops below 5% of the total portfolio value, a warning is sent. When the amount of margin remaining in your portfolio drops to zero or goes negative, the portfolio sorts the generated margin call orders by their unrealized profit and executes each order synchronously until your portfolio is within the margin requirements.</p>
