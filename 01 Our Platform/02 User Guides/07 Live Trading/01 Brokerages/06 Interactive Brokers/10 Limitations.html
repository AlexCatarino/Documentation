<p>Note the following limitations for the <code>InteractiveBrokersBrokerageModel</code>.</p>

<h4>Plans</h4>
<p>You need an IBKR PRO plan. The IB API does not support the IBKR LITE plan.</p>

<h4>Connections</h4>
<p>You can only have 1 connection at a time to your account. To run more than 1 algorithm, open an IB subaccount for each additional algorithm.</p>

<h4>Feeds</h4>
<p>You need a subscription for each <a href="/docs/v2/our-platform/user-guides/live-trading/data-feeds#03-Interactive-Brokers-Data-Feeds">IB data feed</a> that you use in live algorithms. </p>

<h4>ETFs</h4>
<p>You may not be able to trade all assets with the <code>InteractiveBrokersBrokerageModel</code>. For example, if you live in the EU, you canâ€™t trade US ETFs. Check with your local regulators to know which assets you are allowed to trade. You may need to adjust settings in your brokerage account to live trade some assets.</p>


<h4>API Outages<br></h4>
<p>The <code>InteractiveBrokersBrokerageModel</code> uses the IB API to place live trades. Sometimes the API may be down. Check the <a href="https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/software/systemStatus.php">IB status page</a> to see if the API is currently working.</p>

<h4>SMS 2FA</h4>
<p>We don't support Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) via SMS. Use the <a href='https://guides.interactivebrokers.com/iphone/log_in/using_ios.htm'>IB Key protocol in IBKR Mobile</a> instead.</p>

<h4>System Resets</h4>
<p>If your IB account has 2FA enabled, you'll have to re-authenticate once a week. The reset schedule is available on the <a href="https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/software/systemStatus.php">IB Status page</a>. If you miss the timeout period, your algorithm quits executing.</p>
