<p>We model buying power and margin calls to ensure your algorithm stays within the margin requirements. If you set the brokerage model to a different model, the new brokerage model defines how margin is modeled.</p>

<h4>Buying Power</h4>
<p>The <code>DefaultBrokerageModel</code> allows up to 2x leverage for Equity trades and up to 50x leverage for Forex trades from margin accounts.</p>

<h4>Margin Calls</h4>
<p>Regulation T margin rules are enforced with the <code>DefaultMarginCallModel</code>. When the amount of margin remaining in the portfolio drops below 5% of the total portfolio value, a warning is sent. When the amount of margin remaining in the portfolio drops to zero or goes negative, the portfolio sorts the generated margin call orders by their unrealized profit and executes each order synchronously until the portfolio is within the margin requirements.</p>
