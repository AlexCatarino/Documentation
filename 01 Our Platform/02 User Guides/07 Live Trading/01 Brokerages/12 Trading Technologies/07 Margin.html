<p>We model buying power and margin calls to ensure your algorithm stays within the margin requirements and only submits valid orders to TT in live trading.</p>

<h4>Buying Power</h4>
<p>The <code>DefaultBrokerageModel</code> allows up to 1x leverage on Futures trades.<br></p>

<h4>Margin Calls</h4>
<p>Regulation T margin rules are enforced with the <code>DefaultMarginCallModel</code>. When the amount of margin remaining in the portfolio drops below 5% of the total portfolio value, a warning is sent. When the amount of margin remaining in the portfolio drops to zero or goes negative, the portfolio sorts the generated margin call orders by their unrealized profit and executes each order synchronously until the portfolio is within the margin requirements.</p>
