In backtests, the fees are modeled with the <code>FTXFeeModel</code> and the <code>FTXUSFeeModel</code>. The <code>FTXFeeModel</code> charges a 0.02% maker fee and a 0.07% taker fee. The <code>FTXUSFeeModel</code> charges a 0.01% maker fee and a 0.04% taker fee. If you add liquidity to the order book by placing a limit order that doesn't cross the spread, you pay maker fees. If you remove liquidity from the order book by placing an order that crosses the spread, you pay taker fees. You pay the fees in the base currency for maker orders and the quote currency for taker orders. The <code>FTXFeeModel</code> and <code>FTXUSFeeModel</code> do not currently model your 30-day trading volume and FTT balance to adjust the fees. In live trading, FTX and FTXUS adjusts the fees.</p>
