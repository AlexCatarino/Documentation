<p>Note the following limitations of our integration with Tradier.</p>

<h4>ETFs</h4>
<p>You may not be able to trade all assets with the Tradier. For example, if you live in the EU, you canâ€™t trade US ETFs. Check with your local regulators to know which assets you are allowed to trade. You may need to adjust settings in your brokerage account to live trade some assets.</p>

<h4>API Outages</h4>
<p>We call the Tradier API to place live trades. Sometimes the API may be down. Check the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://status.tradier.com/">Tradier status page</a> to see if the API is currently working.</p>
