<p>The live performance page enables you to manually create security subscriptions for your algorithm instead of calling the <code>Add<span class='placeholder-text'>securityType</span></code> methods in your code files. Add manual security subscriptions to your algorithm so that you can place manual trades through the web IDE without having to edit and redeploy the algorithm. Note that you can't manually remove security subscriptions from the web IDE during live execution.</p>
