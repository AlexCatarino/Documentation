<p>The live trading performance page has a <span class="button-name">Liquidate</span> button that acts as a "kill switch" to sell all of the non-Equity holdings in your portfolio at the current market price using market orders and then stop the algorithm. For instance, if your algorithm has a bug in it that caused it to purchase a lot of securities that you didn't want, you can liquidate your portfolio instead of placing many manual trades. </p>
