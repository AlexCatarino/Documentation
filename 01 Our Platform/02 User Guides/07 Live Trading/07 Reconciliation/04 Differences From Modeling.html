<p>The modeling that your algorithm uses can cause differences between backtesting and live trading performance.</p>

<h4>Reality Modeling Error</h4>
<p>We provide <a href="brokerages">brokerage models</a> for predicting fees, slippage, and order fills in backtests. However, these model predictions may not always match the fees that your live algorithm incurs, leading to deviations between backtesting and live trading. You can adjust the reality models that your algorithm uses to more accurrately reflect the specific assets that you are trading. Refer to the  <a href="../../../writing-algorithms/user-guides/reality-modeling/key-concepts">Reality Modeling documentation</a> for guidance on adjusting the models. </p>

<h4>Market Impact</h4>
<p>Lean does not currently model market impact. Therefore, if you are trading large orders, your fill prices can be better during backtesting than live trading, causing deviations between backtesting and live trading. To avoid issues, implement a <a href="../../../writing-algorithms/user-guides/reality-modeling/trade-fills#06-Custom-Fill-Models">custom fill model</a> in your backtests that incorporates market impact.</p>

<h4>Fills</h4>
<p>In backtests, your orders are filled immediately. In live trading, they are sent to your brokerage and take about half a second to execute. If you fill an order in a backtest using stale data, deviations between backtesting and live trading can occur because the order will be filled at a price that is likely different from the real market price. Stale order fills commonly occur in backtests when you create a Scheduled Event with an incompatible data resolution. For instance, if you subscribe to hourly data, place a Scheduled Event for 11:15am, and fill an order during the Scheduled Event, the order will fill at a stale price because the data between 11am and 11:15am is not taken into consideration. To avoid stale fills, only place orders when your algorithm receives price data.<br></p>

<p>In live trading, market orders are filled at whatever price your brokerage fills them. Since the backtesting brokerage models do not know the price at which live orders are filled, the backtest orders are filled based on
 the best price available in the current backtesting data. Similarly, limit orders can be filled at different prices between backtesting and live trading. In backtesting, limit orders are filled as soon as the limit price is hit. In live trading, your brokerage may fill the same limit order at a different price or fail to fill the order, depending on the position of your order in your brokerage's order book.<br></p>

<h4>Borrowing Costs</h4>
<p>We do not currently simulate the cost of borrowing shorts in backtests. Therefore, if your algorithm takes short positions, deviations can occur between backtesting and live trading. We are working on adding the functionality to model borrowing fees. Subscribe to <a href="https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean/issues/4563">GitHub Issue #4563</a> to track our progress.</p>
