<p>Use the deployment wizard in the Algorithm Lab to <a href="/docs/v2/our-platform/tutorials/live-trading/brokerages">deploy your algorithms to live trading</a>. The deployment wizard lets you select a brokerage, enter your brokerage credentials, select a data feed, select a live trading node, set up notifications, and configure automatic algorithm restarts. Most of the brokerages automatically load your cash holdings, position holdings, and submitted orders so that you can algorithm state on the <a href="/docs/v2/our-platform/user-guides/live-trading/results">live performance page</a>. For brokerages that don't automatically load your holdings, you can enter your cash and position holdings in the deployment wizard. After you deploy your algorithms, you can stop their execution at any time in the web IDE.</p>
