<p>Enter a phone number into the deployment wizard to set up SMS notifications. These notifications are rate-limited to 20 messages per hour. If you fully utilize the 20 messages per hour limit, we incur large expenses. Therefore, we ask that you use discretion when sending SMS messages so that we can continue to offer this free service to everyone. SMS notifications are the only type of notification that you don't need an internet connection to receive. If you manually send an SMS notification, you must provide a message.</p>
