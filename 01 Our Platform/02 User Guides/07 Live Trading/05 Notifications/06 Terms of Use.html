<p>If you use notifications, follow our terms of use.</p>

<h4>Backtests</h4>
<p>You can only send notifications in live algorithms. All notifications are ignored in backtesting so that you don't send thousands of notifications when you run a backtest.</p>

<h4>Data Distribution</h4>
<p>You may not distribute data through notifications. We source datasets from external vendors and we must uphold their license terms.</p>

<h4>Brokerage Replacement</h4>
<p>You may not use the notification system to place trades with <a href='/docs/v2/our-platform/user-guides/live-trading/brokerages/unsupported-brokerages'>unsupported brokerages</a>.</p>
