<p>If you have a Download license, you can store datasets on your local machine. This download is for the licensed organization's internal LEAN use only and cannot be redistributed or converted in any format. If you study the data and produce some charts, you may share images of the charts online if the original data can't be to reconstructed from the image.</p>

<p>The cost of the license depends on the dataset and it's calculated on a per-file or per-day basis. You must pay for the Download license with your organization's QuantConnect Credit and you need the <a href="/docs/v2/lean-cli/key-concepts/getting-started">CLI set up</a> to download datasets. Follow these steps to generate commands to download datasets:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Open the <a href="/docs/v2/our-platform/datasets/navigating-the-market#02-View-All-Listings">listing page of the dataset</a> that you want to download.</li>
    <li>Click the <span class="tab-name">CLI</span> tab.</li>
    <li>Fill in the Command Line Generator form.</li>
    <li>Select <span class="button-name">Windows</span> or <span class="button-name">Unix</span>.</li>
    <p>The CLI command to download the dataset displays.</p>
</ol>

<p>To keep your local files up to date, you'll need to download the new files whenever new data becomes available.</p>
