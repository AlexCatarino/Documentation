<p>Every piece of data has a period. Some data is near-instantaneous, like tick data. Other data has a longer period, like second, minute, hour, and daily bars. QuantConnect delivers this data to your algorithms at the end of the period to ensure that lookahead bias doesnâ€™t occur. When you look at the <code>Time</code> property of your algorithm, the period has already ended, so it looks as if the data is offset by one period. To compare the timestamps of our data to other data, use the <code>Time</code> property of the current bar. The <code>Time</code> property of the bar is the start of the bar and the <code>EndTime</code> property is the end of the bar. If you use Python and request historical data, the <code>time</code> index in the DataFrame that's returned maps to the <code>EndTime</code> of the respective bar.
