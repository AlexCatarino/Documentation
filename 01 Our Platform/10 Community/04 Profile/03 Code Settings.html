<p>Your profile's code settings control how some parts of the IDE operate. There are settings for the Strategy Builder, automatic builds, code completion, parameter highlighting, and meta-data sharing. You can edit your code settings from Your Account page. If you adjust your settings, they are saved to your profile so you don't have to set them every time that you log in from a new device.</p>

<h4>Strategy Builder</h4>
<p>The Strategy Builder setting lets you specify if the <a href="/docs/v2/our-platform/user-guides/projects/ide#05-Strategy-Builder">Strategy Builder</a> should launch when you create new projects. If you are new to QuantConnect and want an easy way to generate algorithm code without writing any, enable the setting. If you don't use the Strategy Builder, disable the setting so that you can create new projects faster.</p>

<h4>Automatic Builds</h4>
<p>The Automatic Builds setting lets you specify if the IDE should build your project after each keystroke. To be notified immediately after you've made a coding error, enable the setting. If you don't want to see the red underlining and pop-ups in the IDE before you've finished writing an entire line of code, disable the setting.</p>

<h4>Code Completion</h4>
<p>The Code Completion setting lets you specify if <a href="/docs/v2/our-platform/user-guides/projects/ide#03-Autocomplete-and-Intellisense">autocomplete and Intellisense</a> should be enabled in the IDE. To reduce the number of times that you need to use the API reference or API tree, enable the setting. If you find the autocomplete pop-ups distracting, disable the setting.</p>


<h4>Parameter Highlighting</h4>
<p>The Parameter Highlighting setting lets you specify if the IDE should mark hard-coded parameter values in your algorithms. If you want the IDE to show you where your algorithm may be overfit and where your algorithm can be made more general by removing parameters, enable the setting. If you find the parameter highlighting distracting, disable the setting.</p>


<h4>Meta-Data Sharing</h4>
<p>The Meta-Data Sharing setting lets you specify if your backtest data can be shared with Alpha Streams investors. The data that's shared is the performance statistics, significant holdings, and equity curves of your backtests. This information is just enough data for the funds to determine if they are interested in seeing your algorithm tested live in Alpha Streams. If you share the meta-data, your source code is not shared, you still own the intellectual property of your algorithm and you remain anonymous to the investors. If investors like the performance of your backtest, we may contact you for a licensing opportunity before you submit the algorithm to Alpha Streams. To share your meta-data with Alpha Streams investors, enable the setting. If you don't want to share your meta-data, disable the setting.</p>
