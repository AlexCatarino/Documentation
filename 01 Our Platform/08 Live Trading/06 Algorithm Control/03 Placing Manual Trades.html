<p>The live results page lets you manually place orders instead of calling the automated methods in your project files. You can use any order type that is <a href="/docs/v2/our-platform/user-guides/live-trading/brokerages">supported by the brokerage</a> that you used when deploying the algorithm. You can even liquidate entire positions without having to specify a specific quantity. Some example situations where it may be helpful to place manual orders instead of stopping and redeploying the algorithm include the following:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Your brokerage account had holdings in it before you deployed your algorithm</li>
    <li>Your algorithm had bugs in it that caused it to purchase the wrong security</li>
    <li>You want to add a hedge to your portfolio without adjusting the algorithm code</li>
    <li>You want to rebalance your portfolio before the rebalance date</li>
</ul>

<p>It's not currently possible to cancel manual orders.</p>
