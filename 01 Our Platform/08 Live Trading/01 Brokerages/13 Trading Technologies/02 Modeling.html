<p>The <code>TradingTechnologiesBrokerageModel</code> does not have specific modeling for fees and slippage because TT is not a real brokerage. In live trading, TT reports the total fees of your orders after each order fill. Pass a different <code>BrokerageName</code> to <code>SetBrokerageModel</code> to backtest your algorithm with fee and slippage modeling. The brokerage model you set should support the asset classes and orders in your algorithm.</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
    <pre class="csharp">SetBrokerageModel(BrokerageName.TradingTechnologies, AccountType.Cash);
SetBrokerageModel(BrokerageName.TradingTechnologies, AccountType.Margin);</pre>
    <pre class="python">self.SetBrokerageModel(BrokerageName.TradingTechnologies, AccountType.Cash)
self.SetBrokerageModel(BrokerageName.TradingTechnologies, AccountType.Margin)</pre>
</div>

<p>Our TT integration does not support paper trading through the TT Simulation environment, but you can <a href='/docs/v2/our-platform/tutorials/live-trading/brokerages/trading-technologies#03-Set-Up-Paper-Trading'>simulate it</a> with the QuantConnect Paper Trading brokerage.</p>
