<p>Enter a URL endpoint and some header information into the deployment wizard to set up webhook notifications. The webhook is an HTTP-POST request to the URL. The request is sent with a timeout of 300s. These notifications are rate-limited to 20 requests per hour. If you exceed the limit, each additional Telegram notification costs 5 QCC. You can process these notifications on your web server however you want. For instance, you can inject the content of the notifications into your server's database or use it to create other notifications on your own server.</p>
