<p>The <span class='tab-name'>Logs</span> tab on the live results page displays all of the <a href='/docs/v2/our-platform/projects/debugging#04-Logging-Statements'>logging statements</a> and status messages your algorithm creates. The status messages include all of the points in time when your algorithm deployed, encountered an error, sent an order, or quit executing. It's good practice to add logs in live algorithms because then you can see what is happening while it executes. If you stop and redeploy your algorithm, the logs are retained. You can view the log file on the live results page or download them to your local machine. </p>


<h4>View in the GUI</h4>
<p>To see the log file your algorithm has created, open the live results page and then click the <span class="tab-name">Logs</span> tab.</p>


<h4>Download Log File</h4>
<p>To download the log file, open the live result page, click the <span class="tab-name">Logs</span> tab, and then click <span class="button-name">Download Logs</span>.</p>

<h4>Quotas</h4>
<p>The log files of each project can store up to 100,000 lines for up to one year. If you log more than 100,000 lines or some lines become older than one year, we remove the oldest lines in the files so your project stays within the quota.</p>
