<p>QuantConnect makes backtesting and the research environment available for free and provides co-located servers to run live trading algorithms for a small fee. This offsets our costs and aligns our interests with yours, our client. We also work with brokerages to make your live trading free.</p>

<p>In 2018, driven by user demand, we launched <a href="/docs/v2/our-platform/user-guides/alpha-streams-market">Alpha Streams</a> to systematically match good algorithms with hedge funds. Alpha Streams is the world's first marketplace where hedge funds and retail investors compete to license algorithms developed by QuantConnect community members. When an investor licenses your algorithm, we pass along 100% of your revenues to you and invoice the investor a revenue share equivalent to 30%.</p>
