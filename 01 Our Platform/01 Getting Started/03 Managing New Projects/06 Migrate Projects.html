<p>You must <a href='#03-Auto-Generate-Algorithm-Code'>create a new project</a> before you can migrate it. You must also be the owner of multiple organizations and be currently connected to one of them to migrate projects.</p>

<p>Follow these steps to migrate your project:</p>

<ol>
    <li>In the project panel, click <b>Migrate Project</b>.</li>
    <li>Click the name of the organization to which you want to migrate the project and then click <b>Migrate</b>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Migrating a project creates a copy of the project and stores it in an organization that you own but to which you are not currently connected.</p>
