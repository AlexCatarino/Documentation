<p>The Billing page provides an overview of your organization's payment details. It shows the last 4 digits of the credit card registered to your account and the associated billing information. If you have <a href="/docs/v2/our-platform/user-guides/organizations/administration#05-Permissions">permission</a> to update billing within the organization, you can <a href="/docs/v2/our-platform/tutorials/organizations/billing#03-Edit-the-Credit-Card">edit the billing information</a> from the Billing page. Your organization's billing information is never saved by QuantConnect. Instead, itâ€™s passed to the Stripe billing system.</p>

<p>We bill your organizations on a monthly frequency at the beginning of their monthly services. At the top of the Billing page, you can see the value of your next invoice and your next billing date. The owner of your organization is responsible for the billing, but the responsibility can be delegated in Trading Firm or Institution organizations.</p>

<p>The <span class="page-section-name">Product</span> section on the Billing page lists a breakdown of all the services that your organization is subscribed to and the individual costs of those services that compose the total bill. If you want to change your subscriptions, see the <a href="/pricing">Pricing</a> page. If you cancel your subscription, your live trading nodes are stopped. Therefore, for user safety, your subscriptions automatically renew each month.</p>
