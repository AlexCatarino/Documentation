<p>If you have a project open, it uses a coding session. You can have up to one coding session across all of your free organizations. If you connect as an paid organization, you can have multiple active coding sessions. The following table shows how many active coding sessions you can have on each organization tier:</p>

<?php echo file_get_contents(DOCS_RESOURCES."/quotas/coding-sessions.html"); ?>

<p>The quota for free organizations is a global quota, so you can have one active coding session across all of your free organizations. The quotas for paid organizations are at the organization level. Therefore, if you are in two Quant Researcher organizations, you can have two active coding sessions in one of those organizations and another two active sessions in the other organization.</p>
