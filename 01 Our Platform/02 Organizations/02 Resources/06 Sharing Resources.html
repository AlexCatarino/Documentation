<p>Your organization's nodes are shared among all of the organization's members to reduce the amount of time that nodes idle. In the Algorithm Lab, you can see which nodes are available within your organization. By default, the best-performing resource is selected when you run a backtest or launch a research notebook, but you can select a specific resource to use. If you select a resource that is currently in use, the IDE displays the following error message:</p>
<span class="error-messages">There are spare nodes available in your cluster, but you have elected to not automatically select the best node. Please check a node to use for this backtest or check 'Automatically select best available'.</span>
