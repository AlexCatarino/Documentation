<p>Your organization's nodes are shared among all of the organization's members to reduce the amount of time that nodes idle. In the Algorithm Lab, you can <a href="/docs/v2/our-platform/tutorials/organizations/handling-resources#02-View-All-Nodes">see which nodes are available within your organization</a>. By default, the best-performing resource is selected when running a backtest or launching a research notebook. However, you can select a specific resource to use. If you select a resource that is currently in use, the IDE displays the following error message:</p>
<span class='error-messages'>There are spare nodes available in your cluster, but you have elected to not automatically select the best node. Please check a node to use for this backtest or check 'Automatically select best available'.</span>
