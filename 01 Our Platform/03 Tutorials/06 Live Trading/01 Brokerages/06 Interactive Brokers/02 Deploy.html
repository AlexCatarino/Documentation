<p>You must have an available live trading node for each live trading algorithm you deploy. You need an IBKR Pro account to deploy with IB. The IB API does not support IBKR Lite accounts.<br></p>

<p>Follow these steps to deploy a live algorithm:</p>

<ol>
    <li>If you have not enabled the <b>IB Key Security via IBKR Mobile</b> on your IB account, follow these steps:</li>
    <ol>
        <li>Log in to the IB Client Portal.</li>
        <li>In the top-right corner, click the person icon and then click <b>User Settings</b>.</li>
        <li>On the <b>User Settings</b> page, in the <b>Security</b> section, click the gear icon next to <b>Secure Login System</b>.</li>
        <li>On the <b>Secure Login System</b> page, deselect all options or only select <b>IB Key Security via IBKR Mobile</b>.</li>
    </ol>
    <li><a href="../../projects/managing-projects#05-Open-Existing-Projects">Open the project</a> that you want to deploy.</li>
    <li>Click <b>Go Live</b>.</li>
    <li>On the <b>Deploy Live</b> page, click the <b>Brokerage</b> field and then click <b>Interactive Brokers</b> from the drop-down menu.</li>
    <li>Enter your IB user name, ID, and password.</li>
    <p>Your account details are not saved on QuantConnect.</p>
    <li>If you have subscriptions to IB data feeds and want to use them, click the <b>Data Provider</b> field and then click <b>Interactive Brokers</b> from the drop-down menu.</li>
    <li>If you entered your IB paper trading account credentials, set IB as the data provider, and have not shared your IB data subscriptions with your paper trading account, follow these steps:</li>
    <ol>
        <li>Log in to the IB Client Portal.</li>
        <li>In the top-right corner, click the person icon and then click <b>Account Settings</b>.</li>
        <li>In the <b>Configuration</b> section, click the gear icon next to <b>Paper Trading Account</b>.</li>
        <li>Next to <b>Share real-time market data subscriptions with paper trading account?</b>, click <b>Yes</b>.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>Click the <b>Node</b> field and then click the live trading node that you want to use from the drop-down menu.</li>
    <li><i>(Optional)</i> <a href="../adding-notifications">Set up notifications</a>.</li>
    <li>Configure the <b>Automatically restart algorithm</b> setting.</li>
    <p>By enabling automatic restarts, the algorithm will use best efforts to restart the algorithm if it fails due to a runtime error. This can help improve the algorithm's resilience to temporary outages such as a brokerage API disconnection.</p>
    <li>Click <b>Deploy</b>.</li>
    <p>"Live algorithm deployed successfully" displays.</p>
</ol>

<p>If you know your brokerage positions before you deployed, you can verify they have been loaded properly by checking your equity value in the runtime statistics, your cashbook holdings, and your position holdings.</p>
