<p>You must have an available <a href="/docs/v2/our-platform/user-guides/organizations/resources#04-Live-Trading-Nodes">live trading node</a> for each live trading algorithm you deploy.</p>

<p>Follow these steps to deploy a live algorithm:</p>

<ol>
    <li><a href="/docs/v2/our-platform/tutorials/projects/managing-projects#05-Open-Existing-Projects">Open the project</a> that you want to deploy.</li>
    <li>Click <span class="button-name">Go Live</span>.</li>
    <li>On the Deploy Live page, click the <span class="field-name">Brokerage</span> field and then click <span class="button-name">Trading Technologies</span> from the drop-down menu.</li>
    <li>Enter your TT user name, account name, routing sender, session password, app key, and app secret.</li>
    <p>Our TT integration routes orders via the TT FIX 4.4 Connection. <a rel='nofollow' target='_blank' href='https://www.tradingtechnologies.com/contact/'>Contact your TT representative</a> to set the exchange where you would like your orders sent. Your account details are not saved on QuantConnect.<br></p>
    <li>Click the <span class="field-name">Environment</span> field and then click one of the environments from the drop-down menu.</li>

    <p>The following table shows the supported environments:</p>

    <table class="table qc-table">
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Environment</th>
                <th>Description</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Live</td>
                <td>Trade in the production environment</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>UAT</td>
                <td>Trade in the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://library.tradingtechnologies.com/trade/ttp-uat-trading-environment.html">User Acceptance Testing</a> environment</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <li>Click the <span class="field-name">Node</span> field and then click the live trading node that you want to use from the drop-down menu.</li>
    <li>If your brokerage account has existing cash holdings, follow these steps:</li>
    <ol>
        <li>In the <span class="page-section-name">Algorithm Cash State</span> section, click <span class="button-name">Show</span>.</li>
        <li>Click <span class="button-name">Add Currency</span>.</li>
        <li>Enter the currency ticker (for example, USD or CAD) and a quantity.</li>
        <li>If you want to add additional cash holdings, click the <span class="icon-name">plus sign</span> icon and then continue from step 7.3.</li>
    </ol>
    <li><span class="qualifier">(Optional)</span> <a href="/docs/v2/our-platform/tutorials/live-trading/adding-notifications">Set up notifications</a>.</li>
    <li>Configure the <span class="box-name">Automatically restart algorithm</span> setting.</li>
    <p>By enabling automatic restarts, the algorithm will use best efforts to restart the algorithm if it fails due to a runtime error. This can help improve the algorithm's resilience to temporary outages such as a brokerage API disconnection.</p>
    <li>Click <span class="button-name">Deploy</span>.</li>
    <p>"Live algorithm deployed successfully" displays.</p>
</ol>

<p>If you know your brokerage positions before you deployed, you can verify they have been loaded properly by checking your equity value in the runtime statistics, your cashbook holdings, and your position holdings.</p>
