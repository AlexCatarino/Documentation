<p>You must have an available <a href='/docs/v2/our-platform/user-guides/organizations/resources#04-Live-Trading-Nodes'>live trading node</a> for each live trading algorithm you deploy.</p>

<p>Follow these steps to deploy a live algorithm:</p>

<ol>
    <li><a href="/docs/v2/our-platform/tutorials/projects/managing-projects#05-Open-Existing-Projects">Open the project</a> that you want to deploy.</li>
    <li>Click <span class='button-name'>Go Live</span>.</li>
    <li>On the Deploy Live page, click the <span class='field-name'>Brokerage</span> field and then click <span class='button-name'>Kraken Exchange</span> from the drop-down menu.</li>
    <li>Enter your Kraken API secret and key.</li>
    <p>Gather your API credentials from the <a href="https://www.kraken.com/u/security/api">API Management Settings</a> page on the Kraken website. Your account details are not saved on QuantConnect.</p>
    <li>Click the <span class='field-name'>Verification Tier</span> field and then click your verification tier from the drop-down menu.</li>
    <li>Click the <span class='field-name'>Node</span> field and then click the live trading node that you want to use from the drop-down menu.</li>
    <li>If your brokerage account has existing cash holdings, follow these steps:</li>
    <ol>
        <li>In the <span class='page-section-name'>Algorithm Cash State</span> section, click <span class='button-name'>Show</span>.</li>
        <li>Click <span class='button-name'>Add Currency</span>.</li>
        <li>Enter the currency ticker (for example, USD or BTC) and a quantity.</li>
        <li>If you want to add additional cash holdings, click the <span class='icon-name'>plus sign</span> icon and then continue from step 7.3.</li>
    </ol>
    <li><span class='qualifier'>(Optional)</span> <a href="/docs/v2/our-platform/tutorials/live-trading/adding-notifications">Set up notifications</a>.</li>
    <li>Configure the <span class='box-name'>Automatically restart algorithm</span> setting.</li>
    <p>By enabling automatic restarts, the algorithm will use best efforts to restart the algorithm if it fails due to a runtime error. This can help improve the algorithm's resilience to temporary outages such as a brokerage API disconnection.</p>
    <li>Click <span class='button-name'>Deploy</span>.</li>
    <p>"Live algorithm deployed successfully" displays.</p>
</ol>

<p>If you know your brokerage positions before you deployed, you can verify they have been loaded properly by checking your equity value in the runtime statistics, your cashbook holdings, and your position holdings.</p>
