<p>You must have an available live trading node for each live trading algorithm you deploy.</p>

<p>Follow these steps to deploy a live algorithm:</p>

<ol>
    <li><a href="../../projects/managing-projects#05-Open-Existing-Projects">Open the project</a> that you want to deploy.</li>
    <li>Click <b>Go Live</b>.</li>
    <li>On the <b>Deploy Live</b> page, click the <b>Brokerage</b> field and then click <b>FTX Exchange</b> from the drop-down menu.</li>
    <li>Click the <b>Account Tier</b> and then click your FTX account tier from the drop-down menu.</li>
    <p>Gather your account tier from your <a href="https://ftx.com/profile"><b>Profile</b> page</a> on the FTX website. If your account tier changes after you deploy the algorithm, stop the algorithm and then redeploy it to correct the account tier.<br></p>
    <li>Enter your FTX API secret and key.</li>
    <p>Gather your API credentials from your <a href="https://ftx.com/profile"><b>Profile</b> page</a> on the FTX website. Your account details are not saved on QuantConnect.</p>
    <li>Click the <b>Node</b> field and then click the live trading node that you want to use from the drop-down menu.</li>
    <li>If your brokerage account has existing cash holdings, follow these steps:</li>
    <ol>
        <li>In the <b>Algorithm Cash State</b> section, click <b>Show</b>.</li>
        <li>Click <b>Add Currency</b>.</li>
        <li>Enter the currency ticker (for example, USD or BTC) and a quantity.</li>
        <li>If you want to add additional cash holdings, click the plus sign and then continue from step 7.3.</li>
    </ol>
    <li><i>(Optional)</i> <a href="../adding-notifications">Set up notifications</a>.</li>
    <li>Configure the <b>Automatically restart algorithm</b> setting.</li>
    <p>By enabling automatic restarts, the algorithm will use best efforts to restart the algorithm if it fails due to a runtime error. This can help improve the algorithm's resilience to temporary outages such as a brokerage API disconnection.</p>
    <li>Click <b>Deploy</b>.</li>
    <p>"Live algorithm deployed successfully" displays.</p>
</ol>

<p>If you know your brokerage positions before you deployed, you can verify they have been loaded properly by checking your equity value in the runtime statistics, your cashbook holdings, and your position holdings.</p>
