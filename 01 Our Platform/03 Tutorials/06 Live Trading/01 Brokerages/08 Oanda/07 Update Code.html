<p><a href='#06-Stop-Execution'>Stop the algorithm</a>, edit the code files, and then <a href='#03-Deploy'>redeploy the algorithm</a> to update the code of your live algorithm. When you stop and redeploy a live algorithm, your project's live equity curve is retained between the deployments. If you want to erase the equity curve history, clone the project and then redeploy the cloned version of the project.</p>
