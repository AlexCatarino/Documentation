<p>You must have an available live trading node for each live trading algorithm you deploy.</p>

<p>Follow these steps to deploy a live algorithm:</p>

<ol>
    <li><a href="../../projects/managing-projects#05-Open-Existing-Projects">Open the project</a> that you want to deploy.</li>
    <li>Click <b>Go Live</b>.</li>
    <li>On the <b>Deploy Live</b> page, click the <b>Brokerage</b> field and then click <b>Trading Technologies</b> from the drop-down menu.</li>
    <li>Enter your TT user name, account name, routing sender, session password, app key, and app secret.</li>
    <p>Our TT integration routes orders via the TT FIX 4.4 Connection. Contact your TT representative to set the exchange where you would like your orders sent. Your account details are not saved on QuantConnect.<br></p>
    <li>Click the <b>Environment</b> field and then click one of the following environments:</li>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Live</b>: Trade in the production environment</li>
        <li><b>UAT</b>: Trade in the <a href="https://library.tradingtechnologies.com/trade/ttp-uat-trading-environment.html">User Acceptance Testing</a> environment</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Click the <b>Node</b> field and then click the live trading node that you want to use from the drop-down menu.</li>
    <li>If your brokerage account has existing cash holdings, follow these steps:</li>
    <ol>
        <li>In the <b>Algorithm Cash State</b> section, click <b>Show</b>.</li>
        <li>Click <b>Add Currency</b>.</li>
        <li>Enter the currency ticker (for example, USD or CAD) and a quantity.</li>
        <li>If you want to add additional cash holdings, click the plus sign and then continue from step 7.3.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>(Optional) <a href="../adding-notifications">Set up notifications</a>.
    </li><li>Configure the <b>Automatically restart algorithm</b> setting.</li>
    <p>By enabling automatic restarts, the algorithm will use best efforts to restart the algorithm if it fails due to a runtime error. This can help improve the algorithm's resilience to temporary outages such as a brokerage API disconnection.</p>
    <li>Click <b>Deploy</b>.</li>
    <p>"Live algorithm deployed successfully" displays.</p>
</ol>

<p>If you know your brokerage positions before you deployed, you can verify they have been loaded properly by checking your equity value in the runtime statistics, your cashbook holdings, and your position holdings.</p>
