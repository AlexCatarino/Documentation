<p>You must have an available live trading node for each live trading algorithm you deploy.</p>

<p>Follow these steps to deploy a live algorithm:</p>

<ol>
    <li><a href="../../projects/managing-projects#05-Open-Existing-Projects">Open the project</a> that you want to deploy.</li>
    <li>Click <b>Go Live</b>.</li>
    <li>On the <b>Deploy Live</b> page, click the <b>Brokerage</b> field and then click <b>Coinbase | Pro</b> from the drop-down menu.</li>
    <li>Enter your Coinbase | Pro API key, API secret, and passphrase.</li>
    <p>Generate your API credentials on the <a href="https://pro.coinbase.com/profile/api"><b>API Settings</b> page</a> on the Coinbase | Pro website. Enable <b>View</b> and <b>Trade</b> permissions when you generate the key.<br></p>
    <li>Click on the <b>Environment</b> field and then click one of the following environments:</li>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Live</b>: Trade with real money</li>
        <li><b>Paper</b>: Trade with paper money</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Click the <b>Node</b> field and then click the live trading node that you want to use from the drop-down menu.</li>
    <li><i>(Optional)</i> <a href="../adding-notifications">Set up notifications</a>.</li>
    <li>Configure the <b>Automatically restart algorithm</b> setting.</li>
    <p>By enabling automatic restarts, the algorithm will use best efforts to restart the algorithm if it fails due to a runtime error. This can help improve the algorithm's resilience to temporary outages such as a brokerage API disconnection.</p>
    <li>Click <b>Deploy</b>.</li>
    <p>"Live algorithm deployed successfully" displays.</p>
</ol>

<p>If you know your brokerage positions before you deployed, you can verify they have been loaded properly by checking your equity value in the runtime statistics, your cashbook holdings, and your position holdings.</p>
