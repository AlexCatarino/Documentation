<p>You must have an available <a href='/docs/v2/our-platform/user-guides/organizations/resources#04-Live-Trading-Nodes'>live trading node</a> for each live trading algorithm you deploy.</p>
<p>Follow the <a href="/docs/v2/lean-cli/tutorials/live-trading/local-live-trading">LEAN CLI</a> tutorial to deploy local live algorithms with the Samco brokerage.</p>

<p>If you know your brokerage positions before you deployed, you can verify they have been loaded properly by checking your equity value in the runtime statistics, your cashbook holdings, and your position holdings.</p>
