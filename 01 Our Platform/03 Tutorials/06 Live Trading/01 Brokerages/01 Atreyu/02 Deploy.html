<p>You must have an available live trading node for each live trading algorithm you deploy.</p>

<p>Follow these steps to deploy a live algorithm:</p>

<ol>
    <li><a href="../../projects/managing-projects#05-Open-Existing-Projects">Open the project</a> that you want to deploy.</li>
    <li>Click <b>Go Live</b>.</li>
    <li>Click the <b>Brokerage</b> field and then click <b>Atreyu Brokerage</b> from the drop-down menu.</li>
    <li>Enter your Atreyu user name, password, client ID, request port, and subscription port.</li>
    <li>Click the <b>Node</b> field and then click the live trading node that you want to use from the drop-down menu.</li>
    <li>If your brokerage account has existing cash holdings, follow these steps:</li>
    <ol>
        <li>In the <b>Algorithm Cash State</b> section, click <b>Show</b>.</li>
        <li>Click <b>Add Currency</b>.</li>
        <li>Enter the currency ticker (for example, USD or BTC) and a quantity.</li>
        <li>If you want to add additional cash holdings, click the plus sign and then continue from step 6.3.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>If your brokerage account has existing position holdings, follow these steps:</li>
    <ol>
        <li>In the <b>Algorithm Holdings State</b> section, click <b>Show</b>.</li>
        <li>Click <b>Add Holding</b>.</li>
        <li>Enter the symbol ID, symbol, quantity, and average price.</li>
        <li>If you want to add additional position holdings, click the plus sign and then continue from step 7.3.</li>
    </ol>
    <li><i>(Optional)</i> <a href="../adding-notifications">Set up notifications</a>.</li>
    <li>Configure the <b>Automatically restart algorithm</b> setting.</li>
    <p>By enabling automatic restarts, the algorithm will use best efforts to restart the algorithm if it fails due to a runtime error. This can help improve the algorithm's resilience to temporary outages such as a brokerage API disconnection.</p>
    <li>Click <b>Deploy</b>.</li>
    <p>"Live algorithm deployed successfully" displays.</p>
</ol>

<p>If you know your brokerage positions before you deployed, you can verify that they have been loaded properly by checking your equity value in the runtime statistics, your cashbook holdings, and your position holdings.</p>
