<p>Follow these steps to change the code of your live algorithm:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Stop the algorithm.</li>
    <li>Edit the code files.</li>
    <li>Deploy the algorithm.</li>
    <p>If the brokerage you select in the deployment reveals the Initialize Cash State or Initialize Holdings State sections, add the cash and holdings of the algorithm you stopped.<br></p>
</ol>


<p>When you stop and redeploy a live algorithm, your project's live equity curve will be retained between deployments. If you want to erase the equity curve history, clone the project and then redeploy the cloned version of the project.</p>
