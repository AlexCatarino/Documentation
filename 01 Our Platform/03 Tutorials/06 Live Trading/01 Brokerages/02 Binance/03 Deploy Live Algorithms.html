<p>You must have an available <a href="/docs/v2/our-platform/user-guides/organizations/resources#04-Live-Trading-Nodes">live trading node</a> for each live trading algorithm you deploy.</p>

<p>Follow these steps to deploy a live algorithm:</p>

<ol>
    <li><a href="/docs/v2/our-platform/tutorials/projects/managing-projects#05-Open-Existing-Projects">Open the project</a> that you want to deploy.</li>
    <li>Click <span class="button-name">Go Live</span>.</li>
    <li>On the Deploy Live page, click the <span class="field-name">Brokerage</span> field and then click <span class="button-name">Binance Exchange</span> from the drop-down menu.</li>
    <li>Enter your API key and secret.</li>
    <p>If you are deploying with real capital, gather your API key and secret from the <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/my/settings/api-management">API Management</a> page on the Binance.com website or the <a href="https://www.binance.us/en/usercenter/settings/api-management">API Management</a> page on the Binance.us website. If you are deploying with demo capital, <a href="/docs/v2/our-platform/tutorials/live-trading/brokerages/binance#02-Set-Up-Paper-Trading">generate your API key and secret</a> from the Binance Spot Test Network. Your account details are not saved on QuantConnect.</p>
    <li>Click on the <span class="field-name">Environment</span> field and then click one of the environments.</li>
    <p>The following table shows the supported environments:</p>

    <table class="table qc-table">
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Environment</th>
                <th>Description</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Real</td>
                <td>Trade with real money</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Demo</td>
                <td>Trade with paper money</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <li>Click the <span class="field-name">Node</span> field and then click the live trading node that you want to use from the drop-down menu.</li>
    <li><span class="qualifier">(Optional)</span> <a href="/docs/v2/our-platform/tutorials/live-trading/adding-notifications">Set up notifications</a>.</li>
    <li>Configure the <span class="box-name">Automatically restart algorithm</span> setting.</li>
    <p>By enabling automatic restarts, the algorithm will use best efforts to restart the algorithm if it fails due to a runtime error. This can help improve the algorithm's resilience to temporary outages such as a brokerage API disconnection.</p>
    <li>Click <span class="button-name">Deploy</span>.</li>
    <p>"Live algorithm deployed successfully" displays.</p>
</ol>

<p>If you know your brokerage positions before you deployed, you can verify they have been loaded properly by checking your equity value in the runtime statistics, your cashbook holdings, and your position holdings.</p>
