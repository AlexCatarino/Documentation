<p>To deploy an algorithm to live trading, follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Open the project you want to deploy to live trading.</li>
    <li>Click <b>Go Live</b>.</li>
    <li>Click <b>Select Brokerage</b> and then click the brokerage you want to use to place orders.</li>
    <li>Configure your brokerage account details.</li>
    <p>Depending on the brokerage you select in step 3, you'll have to fill in different fields to authenticate your account. See the table of contents on this page for quick links to instructions for each supported brokerage.<br></p>
    <li>Click the node dropdown and then select a live trading node to use.</li>
    <li>If the deployment wizard has an Initialize Cash State section, follow these steps:</li>
    <li>If the deployment wizard has an Initialize Holdings State section, follow these steps:</li>
    <li>Setup notifications</li>
    <li>Select or deselect the <b>Automatically restart algorithm</b> checkbox.</li>
    <p>By enabling automatic restarts, the algorithm will use best efforts to restart the algorithm if it fails due to a runtime error. This can help improve its resilience to temporary outages such as a brokerage API disconnection.</p>
    <li>Click <b>Deploy</b>.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you know your brokerage positions before you deployed, you can verify they have been loaded properly by checking your equity value in the runtime statistics, your cashbook holdings, and your position holdings.</p>
