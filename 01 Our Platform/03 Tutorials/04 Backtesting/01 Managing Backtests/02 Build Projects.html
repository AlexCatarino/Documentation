<p>If you have the <a href="../community/managing-your-profile#05-Edit-Code-Settings"><b>Automatic Builds</b> setting</a> enabled, your projects will automatically build after each key stroke.</p>


<p>Follow these steps to build your projects manually:</p>

<ol>
    <li><a href="../projects/managing-projects#05-Open-Existing-Projects">Open the project</a> that you want to build.</li>
    <li>Click <b>Build</b>.</li>
    <p>"Building" displays. If the compiler finds errors during the build process, the IDE highlights the lines of code that caused the errors.</p>
</ol>
