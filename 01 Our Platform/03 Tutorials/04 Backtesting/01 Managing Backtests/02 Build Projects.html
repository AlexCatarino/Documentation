<p>If you have the <a href="../community/managing-your-profile#06-Edit-Code-Settings"><b>Automatic Builds</b> setting</a> enabled, your projects will automatically build after each keystroke. <a href="../projects/managing-projects#05-Open-Existing-Projects">Open the project</a> that you want to build and then click <b>Build</b> to manually build the project. When you manually build a project, "Building" displays. </p>

<p>If the build process is unresponsive, try refreshing the page and building again. If the build process continues to be unresponsive, check the <a href='https://status.quantconnect.com/'><b>Status</b> page</a> or contact support. If the compiler finds errors during the build process, the IDE highlights the lines of code that caused the errors.</p>
