<p><a href="../projects/managing-projects#05-Open-Existing-Projects">Open the project</a> that you want to backtest and then click <b>Run</b> to run a backtest. If the project builds successfully, "New backtest: <i>projectName</i> is in the queue" displays. You can refresh or close the page while the backtest is executing without interfering with it because the backtest runs on our cloud servers.</p>
