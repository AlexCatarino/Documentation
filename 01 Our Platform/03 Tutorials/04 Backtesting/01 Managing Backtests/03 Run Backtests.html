<p>Follow these steps to run a backtest:</p>

<ol>
    <li><a href="../projects/managing-projects#05-Open-Existing-Projects">Open the project</a> that you want to backtest.</li>
    <li>Click <b>Run</b>.</li>
    <p>If the project builds successfully, "New backtest: <i>projectName</i> is in the queue" displays.</p>
</ol>

<p>You can refresh or close the page while the backtest is executing without interfering with it because the backtest runs on our cloud servers.</p>
