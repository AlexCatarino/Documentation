<p><a href="../projects/managing-projects#05-Open-Existing-Projects">Open the project</a> that you want to backtest and then click <span class='button-name'>Run</span> to run a backtest. If the project builds successfully, "New backtest: <span class='placeholder-text'>projectName</span> is in the queue" displays. You can refresh or close the page while the backtest is executing without interfering with it because the backtest runs on our cloud servers.</p>
