<p>Open the <a href="accessing-results#02-View-Backtest-Results">backtest results page</a> and then, in the <span class='page-section-name'>Select Chart</span> section, click the <span class='icon-name'>reset</span> icon to refresh the charts. Refreshing the charts resets the zoom level on all the charts. If you refresh the charts while a backtest is executing, only the data that was seen by the Lean engine after you refreshed the charts is displayed.</p>
