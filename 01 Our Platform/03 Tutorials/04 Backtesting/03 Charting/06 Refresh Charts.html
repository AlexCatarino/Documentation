<p>On the <a href="../../user-guides/backtesting/results">backtest results page</a>, in the <b>Select Chart</b> section, click the reset icon to refresh the charts. Refreshing the charts resets the zoom level on all the charts. If you refresh the charts while a backtest is executing, only the data that was seen by the LEAN engine after you refreshed the charts will be displayed.</p>
