    <li>If the Alpha Streams analysis tool determines your algorithm is not suitable for the Alpha Streams Market, improve your algorithm and then continue from step 1.</li>
    <li>Enter a name for the Alpha.</li>
    <p>The name must be at least 10 characters long.</p>
    <li>Enter a description for the Alpha.</li>
    <p>The description must be at least 300 characters long.</p>

    <li>Select an image for the Alpha.</li>
    <li>Select the <b>Yes, I'm live trading this strategy</b> or the <b>No, I'm not live trading this strategy</b> checkbox.</li>
    <li>Select the type(s) of universe selection the algorithm uses and then click <b>Next</b>.</li>
    <li>Select the type(s) that best describe the alpha generation model your algorithm uses and then click <b>Next</b>.</li>
    <li>Select the type(s) of portfolio construction that your algorithm uses and then click <b>Next</b>.</li>
    <li>Select the type(s) of risk control that your algorithm uses and then click <b>Next</b>.</li>
