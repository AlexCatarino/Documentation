<p>You need an organization on a paid tier and an assigned support seat in the organization to request premium support. If you're in an organization on the Quant Researcher tier, the first support seat is automatically assigned to you. If you're in an organization on a different paid tier, the organization manager can assign you a support seat. If you're in an organization on the Free tier, you can request support in the community forum.</p>
