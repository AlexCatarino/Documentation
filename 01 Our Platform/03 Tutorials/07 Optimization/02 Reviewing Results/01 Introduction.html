<p>You should understand how to review backtest results before learning how to review optimization results. Optimization results are automatically shown after launching the optimizer. Follow these steps to access historical optimization results:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Open the project you used to run the parameter optimization.</li>
    <li>Click <b>Results</b>.</li>
    <li>Select the optimization result.</li>
    <p>You'll see a double arrow next to the name if it's an optimization result. Otherwise, it's a backtest result. If you don't see the optimization results, use the pagination tools at the bottom of the page.</p>
</ol>
