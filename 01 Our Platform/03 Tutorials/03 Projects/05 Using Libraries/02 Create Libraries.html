<p>Follow these steps to create a library:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Create a new project.</li>
    <li>In the project panel, click <b>Add New Library</b>.</li>
    <li>Click <b>Create a New Library</b>.</li>
    <li>Write your library in the project files.</li>
    <li>If the root of your project files contains a <b>main.py</b> file, either:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Rename <b>main.py</b>.</li>
        <li>Rename your project files so they are in a directory.</li>
    </ul> 
    <p>When you import the library to a project, the library files are added to your project's root directory. If more than one file in the root directory of your project is named <b>main.py</b>, then your project won't build.</p>
