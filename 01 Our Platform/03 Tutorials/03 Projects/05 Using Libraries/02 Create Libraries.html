<p>Follow these steps to create a library:</p>

<ol>
    <li><a href="/docs/v2/our-platform/tutorials/projects/managing-projects#03-Create-New-Projects">Create a new project</a>.</li>
    <li>In the project panel, click <span class="button-name">Add New Library</span>.</li>
    <li>Click <span class="button-name">Create a New Library</span>.</li>
    <li>Write your library in the project files.</li>
    <li>If the root of your project files contains a <span class="public-file-name">main.py</span> file, <a href="/docs/v2/our-platform/tutorials/projects/managing-files#04-Rename-Files">rename <span class="public-file-name">main.py</span></a> or <a href="/docs/v2/our-platform/tutorials/projects/managing-files#05-Create-File-Directories">move your project files into a directory</a>.</li>
    <p>When you import the library into a project, the library files are added to your project's root directory. If more than one file in the root directory of your project is named <span class="public-file-name">main.py</span>, then your project won't build.</p>
