<p>Follow these steps to add notebook files to a project:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Open the project.</li>
    <li>In the project panel, click <b>Add New Notebook</b>.</li>
    <li>Enter a notebook name and then click <b>OK</b>.</li>
    <p>"File created successfully" displays and the new file opens, opening the Research Environment.</p>
</ol>

<p>You can only open one research notebook per project. If you have a notebook open, to open a different notebook in the same project, stop the research node that the first notebook is using and then open the new notebook.</p>
