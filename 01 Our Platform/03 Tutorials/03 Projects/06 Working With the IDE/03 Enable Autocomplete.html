<p>You need the <a href='community/managing-your-profile#06-Edit-Code-Settings'>Code Completion</a> setting enabled on the Your Account page to use autocomplete.</p>

<p>Follow these steps to use autocomplete:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Open the project in which you want to use autocomplete.</li>
    <li>Type the first few characters of a class member that you want to autocomplete (for example, <code class="python">self.Set</code><code class="csharp">Set</code> or <code>SimpleMovingAverage.Upda</code>).</li>
    <li>Press <span class='key-combinations'>CTRL+Space</span>.</li>
    <p>If there are class members that match the characters you provided, a list of class members displays.</p>
