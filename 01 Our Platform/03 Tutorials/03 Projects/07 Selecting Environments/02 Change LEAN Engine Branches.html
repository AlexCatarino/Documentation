<p>Follow these steps to change the LEAN engine branch that's used to run your backtests and live trading algorithms:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Open the project in which you want to change the LEAN engine branch.</li>
    <li>In the project panel, click <b>LEAN Engine (<i>languageName</i>): <i>branchName</i> (<i>hash</i>)</b>.</li>
    <li>Click the branch that's currently used and then select the new branch.</li>
    <li>If you want to always use the master branch, select the <b>Always use Master Branch</b> checkbox.</li>
    <li>Click <b>Save</b>.</li>
    <p>"Project Lean version saved" displays.</p>
</ol>

<p>Changing the LEAN engine branch only affects the current project. If you create a new project, the new project will use the master branch by default.</p>
