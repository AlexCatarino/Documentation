<p>We aspire to have a welcoming community filled with high-quality discussions about quantitative and algorithmic trading. Since our founding in November 2012, we ran an informal code of conduct and evolved those principles to support the community. Starting January 1st, 2021 as the scale of community content surpassed our ability to review each post, we have sought to write down these guidelines to provide transparency and framework for productive discussions. We welcome your feedback and expect this code of conduct to evolve over time.</p>
