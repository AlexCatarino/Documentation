<p>Your profile's code settings control how some parts of the IDE operate. There are settings for the automatic builds, code completion, and parameter highlighting. You can edit your code settings from your Account page. If you adjust your settings, they are saved to your profile so you don't have to set them every time that you log in from a new device.</p>

<h4>Automatic Builds</h4>
<p>The Automatic Builds setting lets you specify if the IDE should build your project after each keystroke. To be notified immediately after you've made a coding error, enable the setting. If you don't want to see the red underlining and pop-ups in the IDE before you've finished writing an entire line of code, disable the setting.</p>

<h4>Code Completion</h4>
<p>The Code Completion setting lets you specify if <a href="/docs/v2/our-platform/projects/ide#04-Autocomplete-and-Intellisense">autocomplete and Intellisense</a> should be enabled in the IDE. To reduce the number of times that you need to use the API reference or API tree, enable the setting. If you find the autocomplete pop-ups distracting, disable the setting.</p>


<h4>Parameter Highlighting</h4>
<p>The Parameter Highlighting setting lets you specify if the IDE should mark hard-coded parameter values in your algorithms. If you want the IDE to show you where your algorithm may be overfit and where your algorithm can be made more general by removing parameters, enable the setting. If you find the parameter highlighting distracting, disable the setting.</p>
