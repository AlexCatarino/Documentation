QuantConnect supports running multiple algorithms at the same time on <i>different brokerage accounts</i>. When you deploy your second algorithm you can simply select another server and deploy your second algorithm.

Deploying two algorithms to the <i>same</i> brokerage account is slightly more difficult. Imagine you had two algorithms fighting to set the target portfolio; one trying to buy shares in Apple, and the other trying to sell them. Because of this we don't allow deploying two <b>projects</b> to the same account. Instead you can deploy two algorithms in one project via the Algorithm Framework.
