<p>QuantConnect has supported live trading since 2015. We have battle-tested, colocated servers which serve thousands of live trading clients. Our live servers are hosted in Equinix to give our users the best possible stability.&nbsp;</p><p>
    Generally speaking QuantConnect strives to provide a consistent environment between backtesting and live trading; with as few differences as possible and in most situations you will not notice any difference. In the following sections we'll introduce a few features and helpers for your live trading strategies.

    To distinguish between backtesting and live you can use the <code>LiveMode</code> boolean property.
