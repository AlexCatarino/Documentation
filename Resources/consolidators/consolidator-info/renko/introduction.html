  Most Renko consolidators aggregate bars based on a fixed price movement. The <code>RenkoConsolidator</code> produces Renko bars by their traditional definition. 
  In the case of a $1 bar size, the <code>RenkoConsolidator</code> produces bars that have a body spanning $1. 
  The opening price of the first bar is set to the closest $1 multiple of the first trade.
  When the price moves by at least $1, the first bar closes.
  If a bar is a rising bar, the following bar closes when the price moves $1 above the closing price of the previous bar or $1 below the opening price of the previous bar.
  If a bar is a falling bar, the following bar closes when the price moves $1 below the closing price of the previous bar or $1 above the opening price of the previous bar.
  If the price jumps multiple dollars in a single tick, the <code>RenkoConsolidator</code> produces multiple $1 bars in a single time step.
