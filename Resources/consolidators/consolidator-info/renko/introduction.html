<p>Most Renko consolidators aggregate bars based on a fixed price movement. The <code>RenkoConsolidator</code> produces Renko bars by their traditional definition. A <code>RenkoConsolidator</code> with a bar size of $1 produces a new bar that spans $1 every time an asset closes $1 above or below the close of the previous bar. The open and close price of every bar is an interger mulitple of the bar size. If the price jumps multiple dollars in a single tick, the <code>RenkoConsolidator</code> produces multiple $1 bars in a single time step.</p>
