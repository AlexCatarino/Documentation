<p>The values of our indicators can sometimes produce different results than the indicators on other platforms. There can be several reasons for these discrepancies.</p>

<h4>Price Differences</h4>

<p>If you find differences in indicator values, compare the prices that are fed into the indicator on each platform. If the input data is slightly different, the indicator values will be different. To test if it's a difference in price data, feed in the data from the third-party platform into our indicators. We validate the indicators against third-party sources and when the values are the same, the indicator values are similar too.</p>

<h4>Timestamp Differences</h4>

<p>We timestamp our data to the time when the period ends. Many other platforms timestamp to the beginning of the candle.</p>

<h4>Implementation Differences</h4>

<p>Some indicators can have slightly different default arguments for their implementation. A common difference across platforms is to use a different <code>MovingAverageType</code> for the indicators. To view the default arguments for all our indicators, see <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/indicators/supported-indicators'>Supported Indicators</a>. To view the full implementation of our indicators, see the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean/tree/master/Indicators">LEAN GitHub repository</a>.</p>

<h4>Warm Up Period Differences</h4>
<p>Some platforms use all of the historical data to <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/indicators/key-concepts#07-Check-Readiness'>warm up</a> their indicators while LEAN indicators have a fixed number of bars they need to warm up. As a result, indicators with long memory like the Exponential Moving Average can have slightly different values across platforms.</p>

<h4>Risk Free Interest Rate Differences</h4>
<p>Some indicators, like <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/indicators/supported-indicators/sharpe-ratio'>Sharpe ratios</a> and <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/indicators/supported-indicators/sortino-ratio'>Sortino ratios</a>, are a function of the <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/reality-modeling/risk-free-interest-rate/key-concepts'>risk free interest rate</a>. LEAN provides several different ways to define the interest rate, which can lead to different indicator values compared to other platforms.</p>
