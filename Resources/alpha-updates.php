<p>Authors can <a href="/docs/v2/our-platform/tutorials/alpha-streams-market/managing-alpha-listings#05-Update-Alphas">update the code of their Alphas</a> to address live trading issues and to improve the Alphas in light of new findings or shifts in the market environment. The updates must be approved by our review team before they can be published to the market because the updates can not make the Alpha completely different from the earlier implementation that was accepted into the market. When updates are accepted, the new version of the Alpha is deployed, the old version of the Alpha continues to run on our servers until we manually terminate it, and the version number of the Alpha is updated. If the update is critical, we notify all of the investors that they should <a href='/docs/v2/our-platform/tutorials/alpha-streams-market/licensing-alphas#06-Manage-Subscriptions'>deploy the new version of the Alpha</a>.</p>
