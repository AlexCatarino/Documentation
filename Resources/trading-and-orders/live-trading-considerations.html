<p>In live trading, orders fill asynchronously. We send your order to the API of your brokerage and wait for their response to update the state of your algorithm and portfolio. The timing of live order fills doesn't depend on the resolution of your security subscriptions.  When your order fills, the fill price and fee is set by your brokerage. You can add event handlers to your algorithm to <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/live-trading/brokerages#04-Monitor-the-Brokerage-Connection">monitor the brokerage connection</a> and <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/live-trading/brokerages#05-Monitor-Brokerage-Messages">brokerage messages</a>.</p>

<p>In backtesting, the trade fill timing depends on the resolution of your security subscription. For example, if you subscribe to a security with minute resolution data, the algorithm only receives data in one-minute <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/key-concepts/time-modeling/timeslices'>time slices</a>. As a result, the <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/reality-modeling/trade-fills/key-concepts'>fill model</a> can only evaluate if the order should fill on a minute-by-minute frequency.</p>
