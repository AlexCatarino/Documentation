  The opening and closing price of the day is set by very specific opening and closing auction ticks. When a stock like Apple is
  listed, it’s listed on Nasdaq. The open auction tick on Nasdaq is the price that’s used as the official open of the
  day. NYSE, BATS, and other exchanges also have opening auctions, but the only official opening price for Apple is the
  opening auction on the exchange where it was listed.

  We set the opening and closing prices of the first and last bars of the day to the official auction prices. This
  process is used for second, minute, hour, and daily bars for the 9:30am and 4:30pm prices. In contrast, other
  platforms might not be using the correct opening and closing prices.

  The official auction prices are usually emitted 2-30 seconds after the market open and close. We do our best
  to use the official opening and closing prices in the bars we build, but the delay can be so large enough that there
  isn't enough time to update the opening and closing price of the bar before it's injected into your algorithms. For example,
  if you subscribe to second resolution data, we wait until the end of the second for the opening price but most
  second resolution data won’t get the official opening price. If you subscribe to minute resolution data, we wait until
  the end of the minute for the opening auction price. Most of the time, you’ll get the actual opening auction price
  with minute resolution data, but there are always exceptions. Nasdaq and NYSE can have delays in publishing the
  opening auction price, but we don’t have control over those issues and we have to emit the data on time so that you
  get the bar you are expecting.
