<p>If you have a Download license, you can store datasets on your local machine. This download is for the licensed organization's internal LEAN use only and cannot be redistributed or converted in any format. If you study the data and produce some charts, you may share images of the charts online if the original data can't be to reconstructed from the image. The cost of the license depends on the dataset and it's calculated on a per-file or per-day basis. For more information about downloading datasets, see <a href='<?=$link?>'>Downloading Data</a>. If you bulk download datasets, you can download historical data packages or daily updates. In most cases, you need both.</p>
