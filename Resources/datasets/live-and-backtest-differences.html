<p>
  In live trading, bars are built using the exchange timestamps with microsecond accuracy. This microsecond-by-microsecond processing
  of the ticks can mean that the individual bars between live trading and backtesting can have slightly different ticks. As a result, it's possible for a
  tick to be counted in different bars between backtesting and live trading, which can lead to bars having slightly different open, high, low, close, and volume values.
