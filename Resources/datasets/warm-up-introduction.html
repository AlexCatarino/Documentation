  LEAN supports an automated fast-forward system called "Warm Up". 
  It simulates winding back the date you deployed your algorithm by a specific time period. 
  In backtests, it changes the start date of your algorithm to an earlier time.
  In live trading, it fetches data from before your deployment and fast forwards through your strategy up to the present day.
  Warm Up is a great way to prepare your algorithm and its indicators for trading.
  You can't place trades during the warm-up period because they would be operating on fictional fast-forwarded data.
