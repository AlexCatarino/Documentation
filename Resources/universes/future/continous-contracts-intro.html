<p>By default, LEAN only subscribes to the continuous Future contract. A continuous Future contract represents a series of separate contracts stitched together to form a continuous price. If you need a lot of historical data to warm up an indicator, apply the indicator to the continuous contract price series. The <code>Future</code> object has a <code class="csharp">Symbol</code><code class="python">symbol</code> property and a <code class="csharp">Mapped</code><code class="python">mapped</code> property. The price of the <code class="csharp">Symbol</code><code class="python">symbol</code> property is the adjusted price of the continuous contract. The price of the <code class="csharp">Mapped</code><code class="python">mapped</code> property is the raw price of the currently selected contract in the continuous contract series.</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
    <pre class="csharp">// Get the adjusted price of the continuous contract.
var adjustedPrice = Securities[_future.Symbol].Price; 

// Get the raw price of the currently selected contract in the continuous contract series.
var rawPrice = Securities[_future.Mapped].Price;</pre>
    <pre class="python"># Get the adjusted price of the continuous contract.
adjusted_price = self.securities[self._future.symbol].price 

# Get the raw price of the currently selected contract in the continuous contract series.
raw_price = self.securities[self._future.mapped].price</pre>
</div>

<p>The continuous Futures contract isn't a <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/securities/key-concepts#05-Tradable-Status">tradable security</a>. You must place orders for a specific Futures contract. To access the currently selected contract in the continuous contract series, use the <code class="csharp">Mapped</code><code class="python">mapped</code> property of the <code>Future</code> object.</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
    <pre class="csharp">// Place a market order for the currently selected contract in the continuous contract series.
MarkerOrder(_future.Mapped, 1); </pre>
    <pre class="python"># Place a market order for the currently selected contract in the continuous contract series.
self.market_order(self._future.mapped, 1)</pre>
</div>
