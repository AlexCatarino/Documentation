<p>A <code>RollingWindow</code> is an array of a fixed-size that holds trailing data. It's more efficient to use <code>RollingWindow</code> objects to hold periods of data than to make multiple <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/historical-data/history-requests">historical data requests</a>. With a <code>RollingWindow</code>, you just update the latest data point while a <code class="csharp">History</code><code class="python">history</code> call fetches all of the data over the period you request. <code>RollingWindow</code> objects operate on a first-in, first-out process to allow for reverse list access semantics. Index 0 refers to the most recent item in the window and the largest index refers to the last item in the window.</p>
