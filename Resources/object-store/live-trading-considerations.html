<p>When you deploy live algorithms, the state of the Object Store is copied, but it never refreshes. Therefore, if you save data in the Object Store in a live algorithm, you can access the data from the live algorithm, backtests, and the Research Environment. However, if you save content into the Object Store from the Research Environment or a backtest after you deploy a live algorithm, you can't access the new content from the live algorithm.</p>
