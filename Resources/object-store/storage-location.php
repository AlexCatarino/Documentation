<p>The Object Store is organization-specific. When you <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/object-store#04-Save-Data'>save data in the Object Store</a>, it creates a new file in the <span class="public-file-name"><a href="/docs/v2/local-platform/development-environment/organization-workspaces">&lt;organizationWorkspace&gt;</a> / storage / &lt;projectName&gt;</span> directory and names the file with the key you provide. To access the storage data of project A from project B, include the project id of project A to the key.</p>
