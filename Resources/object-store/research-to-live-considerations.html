<p>When you deploy a live algorithm, the data can be accessed within minutes of modifications to the ObjectStore. Ensure your algorithm is able to handle a changing dataset.</p><p>The live environment access to the ObjectStore is much slower than in research and backtesting. Limit the individual objects to less than 50MB to prevent live trading access issues.</p>
