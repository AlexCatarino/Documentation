<p>Debugging is the process of systematically using a tool to find and fix errors in software. Errors can cause unintended trades, unexpected algorithm crashes, and faulty risk management logic. We use a debugging tool step through code line-by-line, and inspect the variables to understand the internal state of the program. You have many tools to debug your algorithm, including our built-in Debugger, logging statements, and charting.</p>
