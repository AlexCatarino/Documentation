<p>The latest master branch on the LEAN GitHub repository is the default engine branch that runs the backtesting, research, and live trading nodes in QuantConnect Cloud.	If you are in an organization on the Trading Firm or Institution tier, you can use <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href='https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean/branches'>custom versions of LEAN</a> in the IDE. The custom versions include historical master branches of Lean and other feature branches. These branches are created by making pull requests, which are reviewed by the Lean team.</p>
