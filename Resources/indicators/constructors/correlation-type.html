<div class="subsection-content">
<p>Pearson Correlation (Product-Moment Correlation): Measures the linear relationship between two datasets. The coefficient ranges from -1 to 1. A value of 1 indicates a perfect positive linear relationship, -1 indicates a perfect negative linear relationship, and 0 indicates no linear relationship. It assumes that both datasets are normally distributed and the relationship is linear. It is sensitive to outliers which can affect the correlation significantly.</p>

<div class="code-snippet"><span class="object-type">field</span> <code>SPEARMAN</code></div>
<div class="subsection-content">
<p>Spearman Correlation (Rank Correlation): Measures the strength and direction of the monotonic relationship between two datasets. Instead of calculating the coefficient using raw data, it uses the rank of the data points. This method is non-parametric and does not assume a normal distribution of the datasets. It's useful when the data is not normally distributed or when the relationship is not linear. Spearman's correlation is less sensitive to outliers than Pearson's correlation. The coefficient also ranges from -1 to 1 with similar interpretations for the values, but it reflects monotonic relationships rather than only linear ones.</p>
