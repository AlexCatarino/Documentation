	Research nodes enable you to spin up an interactive, command-line, Jupyter <a href="/docs/v2/research-environment">Research Environment</a>.
	Several models of research nodes are available. 
	More powerful research nodes allow you to handle more data and run faster computations in your notebooks. 
	The following table shows the specifications of the research node models:

<p>
	Refer to the <a href="/pricing">Pricing</a> page to see the price of each research node model. 
	You get one free R1-4 research node in your first organization, but the node is replaced when you <a href='/docs/v2/cloud-platform/organizations/resources#14-Add-Nodes'>subscribe to a paid research node</a> in the organization.
</p>

<p>
	To view the status of all of your organization's nodes, see the <a href='/docs/v2/cloud-platform/projects/ide#07-Manage-Nodes'>Resources panel</a> of the IDE. 
	When you launch the Research Environment, it uses the best-performing resource by default, but you can <a href='/docs/v2/cloud-platform/projects/ide#07-Manage-Nodes'>select a specific resource to use</a>.
</p>

<p>
	The CPU nodes are available on a fair usage basis. 
	The GPU nodes can be shared with a maximum of three members. 
	Depending on the server load, you may use all of the GPU's processing power.
