<p>The <a href="/docs/v2/cloud-platform/backtesting/report">backtest report</a> provides a summary of your algorithm's performance. Follow these steps to generate one:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Open the backtest results page for which you want to generate a report.</li>
    <li>Click the <span class="tab-name">Report</span> tab.</li>
    <li>If the project doesn't have a description, enter one and then click <span class="button-name">Save</span>.</li>
    <li>Click <span class="button-name">Download Report</span>.</li>
    <p>The report may take a minute to generate.</p>
