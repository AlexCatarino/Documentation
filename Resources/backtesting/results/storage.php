<p>You can store data in the <a href='<?=$osLink?>'>ObjectStore</a> during a backtest and then load the data into the Research Environment for further analysis. The <a href='/docs/v2/research-environment'>Research Environment</a> is a Jupyter notebook-based environment with access to many <a href="/docs/v2/cloud-platform/projects/package-environments">third-party libraries</a>, so you can <a href="/docs/v2/research-environment/charting">produce plots</a> and display DataFrames in many more ways than the backtest results page supports.</p>
