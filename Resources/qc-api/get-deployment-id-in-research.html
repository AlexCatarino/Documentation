<p>To get the deployment Id, <a href='/docs/v2/cloud-platform/live-trading/results#12-View-All-Live-Projects'>open a live result in the Algorithm Lab</a> and check its <a href='/docs/v2/cloud-platform/backtesting/results#12-Logs'>log file</a>. An example deployment Id is L-ac54ffadf4ca52efabcd1ac29e4735cf. If you have deployed the project multiple times, the log file has multiple deployment Ids. In this case, use the most recent Id.</p>
