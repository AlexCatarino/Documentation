<p>The Research Environment is a <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/notebook.html">Jupyter notebook</a>-based environment where you can access our data through the <code>QuantBook</code> class instead of through the <code>QCAlgorithm</code> class in a backtest. The environment supports both Python and C#. If you use Python, you can import code from the code files in your project into the Research Environment to aid development.</p>
