    Your code is stored in a database, isolated from the internet. When the code leaves the database it is compiled and
    obfuscated before being deployed to the cloud. If the cloud servers were compromised, this process makes it
    difficult to read your strategy.

    As we've seen over recent years, there can never be any guarantee of security with online websites. However, we
    deploy all modern and common security procedures. We deploy nightly software updates to keep the server up to date
    with the latest security patches. We also used SSH key login to avoid reliance on passwords. Internally, we use
    processes to ensure only a handful of people have access to the database and we always restrict logins to never use
    root credentials.
