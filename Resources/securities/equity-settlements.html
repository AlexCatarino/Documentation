<p>If you trade with a margin account, trades settle immediately. In backtests, the default settlement rule for Equity cash trades is T+3 at 8 AM Eastern Standard Time (EST). For example, if you sell on Monday, the trade settles on Thursday at 8 AM. For more information about settlement modeling, see <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/reality-modeling/settlement/key-concepts'>Settlement</a>.</p>

<p>In live trading, cash trades generally settle at T+2. We plan to update the backtest settlement rules to T+2 so it matches live trading behavior. To track our progress, subscribe to <a rel='nofollow' target='_blank' href='https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean/issues/6184'>GitHub Issue #6184</a>.
