<p>
  The <code>TradeBuilder</code> tracks the trades of your algorithm and calculates some statistics. 
  Some of these statistics are a function of the <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/reality-modeling/risk-free-interest-rate/key-concepts'>risk free interest rate</a> and the <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/initialization#10-Set-Algorithm-Settings'>number of trading days per year</a>.
  You can adjust how the <code>TradeBuilder</code> defines a trade and how it matches offsetting order fills.
