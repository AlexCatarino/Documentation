<p>
    If you run the LEAN engine locally with <?=$leanCli ? "the CLI" : "QuantConnect Local Platform"?>, LEAN executes in a Docker container.
    These Docker containers contain a minimal Linux-based operating system, the LEAN engine, and all the packages available to you on QuantConnect.com.
    It is therefore required to install Docker if you plan on using <?=$leanCli ? "the CLI" : "QuantConnect Local Platform"?> to run the LEAN engine locally.
