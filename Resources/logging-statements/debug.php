<p>Debug statements are the same as log statements, but <code>Debug</code> statements are orange in the Cloud Terminal. Use these statements when you want to give more attention to a message in the Cloud Terminal. Debug messages are capped at 200 characters in length. If you send multiple debug statements within one second, your messages are rate-limited to avoid crashing your browser.<br></p>
