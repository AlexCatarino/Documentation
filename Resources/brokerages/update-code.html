<p>Follow these steps to update the code of your live algorithm:</p>
<ol>
    <li><a href='#07-Stop-Execution'>Stop the algorithm</a></li>
    <li>Edit the code files</li>
    <li><a href='#04-Deploy-Live-Algorithms'>Redeploy the algorithm</a></li>
</ol>

<p>When you stop and redeploy a live algorithm, your project's live equity curve is retained between the deployments. To erase the equity curve history, clone the project and then redeploy the cloned version of the project.</p>
