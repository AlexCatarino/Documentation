<h4>Margin Calls</h4>
<p>
    Regulation T margin rules apply. When the amount of margin remaining in your portfolio drops below 5% of the
    total portfolio value, you receive a <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/reality-modeling/margin-calls#08-Monitor-Margin-Call-Events'>warning</a>. 
    When the amount of margin remaining in your portfolio drops to zero
    or goes negative, the portfolio sorts the generated margin call orders by their unrealized profit and executes each
    order synchronously until your portfolio is within the margin requirements.
