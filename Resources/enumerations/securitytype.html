        <td>Futures Options Security Type. Futures options function similar to equity options, but with a few key differences. Firstly, the contract unit of trade is 1x, rather than 100x. This means that each option represents the right to buy or sell 1 future contract at expiry/exercise. The contract multiplier for Futures Options plays a big part in determining the premium of the option, which can also differ from the underlying future's multiplier. </td>
