<p>If you one of your team members creates a project, adds a <a href='/docs/v2/lean-cli/projects/libraries/project-libraries'>project library</a> to it, and then adds you as a collaborator to the project, you can pull the project but not the library. To pull the library as well, your team member must add you as a collaborator on the library project.</p>
