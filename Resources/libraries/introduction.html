<p>Libraries (or packages) are third-party software that you can use in your projects. You can use many of the available open-source libraries to complement the classes and methods that you create. Libraries reduce your development time because it's faster to use a pre-built, open-source library than to write the functionality. Libraries can be used in backtesting, research, and live trading. We support various libraries for machine learning, plotting, and data processing in QuantConnect Cloud. As members often request new libraries, we frequently add new libraries to the underlying docker image that runs the Lean engine. </p>

<p>This feature is primarily for Python algorithms, as not all Python libraries are not compatible with each other. We've bundled together different sets of libraries into distinct environments. To use the libraries of an environment, set the environment in your project and add the relevant <code class="csharp">using</code><code class="python">import</code> statement of a library at the top of your file.</p>
