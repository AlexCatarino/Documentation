<p>Libraries are third-party software repositories that you can use in your projects. You can use many of the available open-source libraries to complement the classes and methods that you create. Libraries reduce your development time because it's faster to use a pre-built, open-source library than to write the functionality. Libraries can be used in backtesting, research, and live trading.<br></p>
