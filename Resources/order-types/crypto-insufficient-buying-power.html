<p>When you place Crypto trades, ensure you have a sufficient balance of the base or quote currency before each trade. If you hold multiple assets and you want to put all of your capital into BTCUSDT, you need to first convert all your non-BTC assets into USDT and then purchase BTCUSDT.</p>

<p>By default, the account currency is USD and your starting cash is $100,000. Some crypto exchanges do not support fiat currencies, and you cannot convert the $100,000 to the pair quote currency. To set the account currency and your starting cash, call the <code>SetAccountCurrency</code>method.</p>
<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="csharp">SetAccountCurrency("USDT", 1000);   // Set account currency to Thether and its quantity to 1000 USDT</pre>
<pre class="python">self.SetAccountCurrency("USDT", 1000)   # Set account currency to Thether and its quantity to 1000 USDT</pre>
