Alpha Streams licensing is performed with a monthly subscription, prorated on a daily basis. Funds can manage their subscriptions programmatically, licensing your Alpha as their models require. A subscription revenue model for Alpha has several benefits over a classic revenue sharing model:<ul>   <li>No Audit Requirements: Assigning a profit value to a factor is subjective and requires knowledge of the fund existing portfolio and models.</li>   <li>No Allocation Tracking: Whether or not a fund allocates capital your Alpha still generated value and will receive the same revenue from licensing.</li>   <li>Optimized Alpha Value: An efficient price for an Alpha can be discovered faster with a simple subscription; maximizing the revenues for authors when Alphas are performing well, and allowing funds to cut expenses when doing poorly.</li></ul></p><p>QuantConnect directly charges the funds a 30% fee for reviewing, hosting and serving the algorithms. Charging funds directly ensures as much licensing revenue is passed back to you the creator as possible.</p><img class="img-responsive" src="https://cdn.quantconnect.com/docs/i/revenue-model.png"/>
