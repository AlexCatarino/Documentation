Alpha Streams is a global marketplace where Quants and Funds meet. Quants offer their alpha (algorithms) for licensing, and Funds can quickly locate crowd-sourced strategies which fit their target criteria. QuantConnect provides an independent third party to verify the strategy performance, and run it out of sample in our production environment.
