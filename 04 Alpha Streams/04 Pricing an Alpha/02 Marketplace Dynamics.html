The Alpha Streams marketplace efficiency is in part determined by the infrastructure in place to find the efficient price. Although we have plans for a more advanced marketplace, currently it is principally a manual process. An Alpha price can be changed manually by the Authors at anytime but the pricing update is delayed by one month if there are funds subscribed.
