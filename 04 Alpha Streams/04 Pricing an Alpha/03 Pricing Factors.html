Although pricing is driven by the marketplace, there are many factors which go into a buyers decision-making process that can help focus your design. Contrary to what you might think it isn't all about performance. Some of these factors include:</p><h4>Uniqueness</h4><p>Is your alpha highly similar to other Alphas in the market? Does it utilize identical assets to Alphas already listed? Listing a near identical Alpha will likely drive the price of both Alpha models down.</p><h4>Beta</h4><p>Does your Alpha correlate highly with the broader market benchmark? Alphas with high S&amp;P correlations are less valuable as they can simply be replaced with the benchmark.</p><h4>Forward Trading Track Record</h4><p>Does your Alpha have any live trading track record or perform differently relative to its backtests? It makes sense the longer an Alpha with a long track record will be more valuable.</p><h4>Insight Accuracy</h4><p>Insight prediction accuracy is the most basic predictor of the Alpha value. If your Alpha can reliably predict the expected return of the market, it will be easily monetizable.</p><h4>Supply and Demand</h4><p>Are there multiple hedge funds in the market focused on your Alpha investment style? Alphas with more competing bidders will likely be able to command a higher fee.</p>
