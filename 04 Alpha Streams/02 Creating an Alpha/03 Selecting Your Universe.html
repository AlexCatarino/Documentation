Universe Selection is the first model of the Algorithm Framework. QuantConnect provides four techniques for selecting an asset universe: Coarse, Fine, Scheduled and Manual Universes. For more information on defining your universe see the documentation on <a href="/docs/algorithm-framework/universe-selection">Algorithm Framework/Universe Selection</a>. Depending on your algorithm you can likely use one of these helpers to select the stocks required.</p><h4>Manual Universe Selection</h4><p>Manual Universes are primarily used for a fixed set of assets representing a broader index. You may be selecting a basket of ETF's or set of Forex Symbols representing the entire universe.</p><h4>Coarse and Fine Universe Selection</h4><p>Coarse and Fine Universes allow you to select US Equities based on price-volume action or corporate fundamental data. They are useful for filtering large volumes of information down to a smaller actionable set of assets.</p><h4>Scheduled Universe Selection</h4><p>Scheduled Universes trigger at defined points in time and run a generic function. This is useful for using an external API or file to define your universe source. As we must ensure Alpha algorithms are robust only some external data sources are approved for Alpha Streams. Make sure to get your data approved before submission to Alpha Streams. DropBox/FTP driven universes require your continual effort so are not an approved universe source.</p>
