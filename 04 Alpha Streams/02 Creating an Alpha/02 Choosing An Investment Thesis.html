The investment thesis is arguably the most important, and artistic part of the alpha creation process. Here you should imagine a hypothesis which will guide your implementation. The thesis is typically a quantifiable effect (something we can measure) which we believe has an impact on our selected assets.</p><p>It is important to choose a single thesis per Alpha. Combining multiple theories in a single strategy prevents external funds from being able to discern the components. If your algorithm has multiple signals you believe should be combined list them as a separate Alpha, and link to them in the Alpha description.
