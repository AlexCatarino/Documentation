The investment thesis is arguably the most important, and artistic part of the alpha creation process. Here you should imagine a hypothesis which will guide your implementation. The thesis is typically a quantifiable effect (something we can measure) which we believe has an impact on our selected assets.</p><p>Each Alpha should implement one investment thesis. Combining multiple theories in a single strategy prevents external funds from being able to discern the components. If your algorithm has other signals you believe should be used together, list them as a separate Alpha and link to them in the Alpha description.

Some examples of a focused alpha model are:
<ul>
<li>"Profitability Alpha" - Company profitability as a signal of its upward motion.</li>
<li>"Public Sentiment Alpha" - Public opinion as an indicator of company trajectory.</li>
<li>"Product Demand Alpha" - Tracking sales to project the trajectory of a company.</li>
</ul>
</p>

Your alpha <i>does not need to perform well in all markets</i> to be a good alpha. The fund consuming the alpha will need to decide when to apply your signal. In fact, the more focused your alpha is the more widely applicable it will be to potential clients.
