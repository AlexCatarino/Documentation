Alphas are reviewed for five <b>technical</b> criteria. We aim to not impose any value bias during an Alpha review but primarily to ensure they are mechanically sound. When submitting your Alpha please review it for the following points:</p><h4>Stateless &amp; Resilient</h4><p>Mechanisms should be setup to restore internal state in the event of reboots. Alphas will be very long running. Over the course of months or years, the server will need patches and occasional restarting. The alpha should be smart enough to automatically recover in the event of restart using History and WarmUp API methods.</p><h4>Use Reliable Data Sources</h4><p>Alphas should use public data, commercial feeds or QuantConnect's data. Importing a personal dataset through DropBox isn't reliable enough to build a long-term track record and ensure the Alpha will continue working as expected. You should use public data sources (e.g. Quandl), commercial data, or QuantConnect supplied data.</p><h4>Grounded in Reality</h4><p>Alphas should have clear strategic reasoning underpinning the strategy. A single reason based foundation for the algorithm is necessary to understand the alpha behavior when things go wrong, and it helps improve your alpha application for funds. Obscure correlations or overfitted strategies tend to perform poorly out of sample.</p><h4>Transparent Sourcing</h4><p>Authors need a transparent employment history and alphas must not infringe on other IP. We'd like to know the employment history of authors on the platform and ensure the alpha is not infringing on any intellectual property, including your current and past employers. Public or shared content may be used as a foundation and extended. Where you may have licensed the IP from a third party, presenting consents for usage are acceptable.</p>
