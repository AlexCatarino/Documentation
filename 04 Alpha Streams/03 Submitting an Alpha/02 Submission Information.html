Alpha submissions provide some information funds can use to help them license your strategy. Start by giving your strategy an appropriate name for the Alpha, along with a description of the Alpha strategy. Most Alphas are relatively simple so a sentence or two is fine here. Alpha pricing is covered in the <a href="/docs/alpha-streams/pricing-an-alpha">Pricing an Alpha</a> section.</p><img class="img-responsive" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.quantconnect.com/docs/i/alpha-dashboard-description.png"/> <br /><p>Don't worry too much about making this perfect; you can update these fields later as your Alpha improves.</p>
