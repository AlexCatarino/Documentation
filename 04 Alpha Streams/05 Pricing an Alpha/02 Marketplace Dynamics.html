The Alpha Streams marketplace efficiency is, in part, determined by the infrastructure in place to find the efficient price. Although we have plans for a more advanced marketplace, currently it is a principally manual process. An Alpha price can be changed manually by the Authors once per month. If there are funds actively licensing the strategy, they will have the choice to continue or stop their license.
</p><p>Licenses are per month, but billing is prorated daily with a minimum of one day of licensing revenue. This barrier is intended to be low enough that funds can easily harness your strategy.</p>
