  Institutional investors deposit margin with a prime brokerage and are then offered an almost infinite leverage to perform
  trading as long as they stay within target risk parameters. For this reason control over "leverage" is done by the institution
  and strategies are forced to use no leverage. If you require more buying power simply increase your starting portfolio allocation cash.
