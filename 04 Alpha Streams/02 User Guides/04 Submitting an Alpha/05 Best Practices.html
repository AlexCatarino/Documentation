<p>
    Alpha Licensors have access to the Alpha Logs. The Alpha should provide enough logging to understand the strategy behavior to evaluate unexpected insights/orders without giving up too much information that can be used to reverse-engineer the Alpha.

<h4 id='crypto-wallet'>Crypto-Currencies Wallet</h4>
<p>
	Algorithms that trade crypto-currencies should test different crypto-currencies starting cash books. Crypto-currency brokerages, such as Coinbase, does not hold virtual position information. When an algorithm is (re-)deployed, it will fetch the coins in the wallet and consider all positions to be flat. Consequently, the Alpha will not find a USD-only cashbook most of the time.
