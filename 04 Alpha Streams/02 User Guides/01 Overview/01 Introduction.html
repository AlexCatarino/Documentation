<p> ALEX: I think this shuold be repeated in the Alpha Stream Market in Our Platform profuct because its part of the Alpha Stream Market. Also Instead of starting this product we should start with what/what for alpha and insight. Potentially adding the common Alpha features information here too.</p>
<p> ALEX: We should remove Upgrading Classic and move that part to a tutorial. In fact, two tutoroal for each Framework and Classic, and creating Alpha would focus on the fundamental idead behind an Alpha</p>

Alpha Streams is a global marketplace where Quants and Funds meet. Quants offer their alpha (algorithms) for licensing, and Funds can quickly locate crowd-sourced strategies that fit their target criteria. QuantConnect acts as an independent third party to verify the strategy performance, and run it out of sample in our production environment on live market data.
