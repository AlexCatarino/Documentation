	Once your Alpha has met the minimum criteria listed above, it is then reviewed by our team. We aim to not impose any value bias during an Alpha review, but we need to ensure they are mechanically sound. 
	When reviewing your Alpha, we will consider the following points:
</p>

<h4 id = "ip-infringement">IP Infringement</h4>
<p>
    All Alphas must be the intellectual property (IP) of the submitting author.
</p>

<h4 id='transparent-sourcing'>Transparent Sourcing</h4>
<p>
	Authors need a transparent employment history and alphas must not infringe on other IP. We'd like to know the employment history of authors on the platform to ensure the alpha is not infringing on any intellectual property, including your current and past employers. Public or shared content may be used as a foundation and extended. Where you may have licensed the IP from a third party, presenting consents for usage are acceptable.
</p>

<h4 id="open-source-ip">Open-Source IP</h4>
<p>
	We provide the community with lots of example algorithms. A few examples to get you started can be found <a href="https://www.quantconnect.com/blog/from-research-to-production-tutorials/">in this blog post</a>, or on <a class="python" href="https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean/tree/master/Algorithm.Python">GitHub</a><a class="csharp" href="https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean/tree/master/Algorithm.CSharp">GitHub</a>.
    The goal of this is to demonstrate how to use the API correctly, incorporate new data sources into their 
    existing algorithms, implement our recommended best practices for Alpha Streams, and more. However, we cannot accept any copies or near-copies of 
    our demonstration algorithms into Alpha Streams. We love to see that our work inspired someone, but each submission must provide sufficient originality that the work can indeed be called the author's own.
</p>

<h4 id="grounded-in-reality">Grounded in Reality</h4>
<p>
	Alphas should have clear strategic reasoning underpinning the strategy. A single reason-based foundation for the algorithm is necessary to understand the alpha behavior when things go wrong, and it helps improve your alpha application for funds. Obscure correlations or overfitted strategies tend to perform poorly out of sample.
</p>

<h4 id="stateless-resilient">Stateless &amp; Resilient</h4>
<p>
	Mechanisms should be set up to restore the internal state of an Alpha in the event of reboots. 
    Alphas will be very long-running; over the course of months or years, the server will need patches and occasional restarting. The alpha should be smart enough to automatically recover in the event of restart using History and WarmUp API methods.
</p>

<h4 id="trade-on-first-day">Trade On First Day</h4>
<p>
	Algorithms are required to trade on the day of deployment. Investors expect that licensed alphas start trading soon to justify their investment, and to acknowlegde that the algorithm is working as expected. 
</p>

<h4 id="edge-case-handling">Edge Case Handling</h4>
<p>
	Alphas need to be able to handle edge cases such as Dividends, Splits, and Delistings. This adds another layer of resiliency and will keep an Alpha running in the event of data changes. This can involve simple control logic, checking <code>data.ContainsKey(symbol)</code>, explicitly removing certain affected securities from the Universe, or other methods.
</p>

<h4 id="inaccurate-price">Inaccurate Price</h4>
<p>
	Alphas cannot log the following message:
	<i>
	The security does not have an accurate price as it has not yet received a bar of data. Before placing a trade (or using SetHoldings) warm up your algorithm with SetWarmup, or use slice.Contains(symbol) to confirm the Slice object has price before using the data. Data does not necessarily all arrive at the same time so your algorithm should confirm the data is ready before using it. In live trading this can mean you do not have an active subscription to the asset class you're trying to trade. If using custom data make sure you've set the 'Value' property.
	</i>
	This is a particular edge case that an order was placed before market data was used to set the security prices.
</p>
<p>
	Ideally, orders should not be tagged with the "filled with stale prices" message. It can be caused by trading illiquid securities. However, it is often seen when an algorithm places a trade right after the market opens and there is no data from the current trading day.
</p>

<h4 id="invalid-order">Invalid Order</h4>
<p>
	Algorithms cannot place orders that are not validated by QCAlgorithm (<code>OrderStatus.Invalid</code>). Most of invalid orders are due insuficient buying power, meaning that the position sizing and capital allocation should be adjusted accordingly.
</p>

<h4 id="high-resolution-data">High-Resolution Data</h4>
<p>
	Algorithms are required to use minute-resolution market data (or higher: second or tick). Using daily or hourly data can lead to unexpected results and trades as well as unrealistic performance, since those data resolutions do not include L1 data (bid and ask) that is necessary for realistic order fills.
</p>

<h4 id='supported-data-sources'>Supported Data Sources</h4>
<p>
    When a fund licenses an Alpha, we need to guarantee them that it will perform without error and be of the highest quality possible. 
    To do this, we can't accept any submissions that use an external data source that is not built into LEAN (i.e., dropbox files, SubscriptionDataReader, etc.). 
    If we don't directly support the data, then we are unable to guarantee its integrity and that it will be maintained faithfully.
</p>
<p>
    We currently don't support futures or option data in Alpha Streams. We are actively working on this and hope to enable futures and options support soon.
</p>

<h4 id="real-brokerage-compatible">Real Brokerage Compatible</h4>
<p>
    There are not restriction on security types combinations in the Alpha Market. However, since Alphas are deployed to real accounts, they cannot trade a group of securities that include unsupported types for the supported brokerages. For example, an Alpha that trades equity and crypto-currencies cannot be deployed to any brokerage other than QuantConnect Paper Trading.
</p>

<h4 id="insights">Insights</h4>
<p>
    Insights are predictions about the price movement of specific securities and are required in all Alpha Streams submissions. They provide funds with information about the predictive power of your models and give them insight into why the orders they see are being placed. Funds can better replicate backtest results using the API when Insights contain values for the "Weight" field, which will allow them to better understand position sizing and capital allocation.
</p>
<p>	
    For classic algorithms, one of the <a href = "https://www.quantconnect.com/docs/alpha-streams/creating-an-alpha">Insight constructors</a> must be 
    used and emitted using the <a href="https://www.quantconnect.com/docs/alpha-streams/upgrading-classic-algorithms">EmitInsights API</a>.
</p>
<p>
	For Framework-style algorithms, Insights need to be generated in the Update() method of the Alpha Model. These will then be used in the Portfolio Construction Model (PCM) to build a portfolio. If the PCM is responsible for defining the weight that each security should have in the portfolio, the Weight field is not required.
</p>

<h4 id="low-allocation">Low Allocation</h4>
<p>
	Algorithms don't need to sustain open positions, and use all buying power during its runtime, but the allocation cannot be consistenly low (e.g.: 50% cash, 50% equities) by design.
</p>

<h4 id="overfitting">Overfitting</h4>
<p>
    <a href="https://www.quantconnect.com/docs/key-concepts/research-guide#Research-Guide-What-Is-Overfitting">Overfitting</a> will doom an algorithm in live trading. To prevent this and try to boost the quality of submissions, we can't accept any 
    Alphas that obviously overfit to data. Overfitting can manifest itself in countless ways, but the most common things we see are:
</p>

 <ul>
    <li>Coding of indicator parameters that work for certain hand-picked assets but perhaps not for any others.</li>
    <li>Using thresholds for indicator values that are hard-coded and have no fundamental theory behind their value.</li>
    <li>Look-ahead bias, such as hard-coding specific dates to perform specific actions. This can only be done if there is prior knowledge of an event. Look-ahead bias might boost the backtest, but it does not mean the model is fundamentally valuable and can sustain performance during future outliers/extreme events.</li>
    <li>Selection bias, such as picking stocks known ahead of time to perform exceptionally well during specific periods.</li>
</ul>
