<p>Before your submission is sent to us for the final code review, we run an analysis on the selected backtest. This is done to ensure that seven essential criteria are met.</p>
<table class="table qc-table table-itemized table-reflow">
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th colspan="2">
            Pre-Submission Screening Criteria
        </th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td width="30%">Length<br>
			</td>
			<td>
				<p>Backtests must be a minimum of 5, and a maximum of 7 years in length.
				</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td width="30%">Recent History</td>
			<td>
				<p>The backtest must include the most most recent 5 years of data and can't have an End Date more than 7 days priod to the date of submission.</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td width="30%">Alpha Streams Brokerage Model</td>
			<td><code>AlphaStreamsBrokerageModel()</code>
				<p>Alphas are required to use the <a href="https://www.quantconnect.com/docs/alpha-streams/alpha-fee-models">Alpha Streams Brokerage Model</a> and cannot include any additional <a href="https://www.quantconnect.com/docs/algorithm-reference/reality-modelling">Reality Modeling</a> or set different leverage.</p>
			</td>

		<tr>
			<td width="30%">Profitability</td>
			<td>
				<p>All Alpha submissions must be profitable over the course of the backtest.</p>
			</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
			<td width="30%">Known Data Sources</td>
			<td>
				<p>We can't guarantee the integrity of any external data sources. Only <a href="https://www.quantconnect.com/docs/data-library/equity">data sources supported by QuantConnect</a> can be used in Alphas.</p>
			</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
			<td width="30%">PSR Greater than 80%</td>
			<td>
				<p>All Alpha submissions must have a <a href="https://www.quantconnect.com/forum/discussion/6483/probabilistic-sharpe-ratio/p1">Probabilistic Sharpe Ratio</a> (PSR) of greater than 80%.</p>
			</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
			<td width="30%">Low Correlation to Current Alphas</td>
			<td>
				<p>Alphas need to be sufficiently unique, so we test the correlation between submissions and an author's other accepted Alphas. Correlation must be less than 85%. Updates to current versions are not tested for correlation.</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
        <tr>
			<td width="30%">Quick Drawdown Recovery</td>
			<td>
				<p>Algorithms that fail to recover from a drawdown greater than 10% within 6 months will likely not be accepted.</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td width="30%">Frequent Trading</td>
			<td>
				<p>Algorithms don't need to emit Insights or trade daily or intraday, but the maximum holding period for funds is usually a matter of days or weeks. Anything longer than monthly-rebalancing likely won't be accepted. Alphas need to place at least 10 trades per month for the majority of the backtest.</p>

		<tr>
			<td width="30%">Sufficient Capacity</td>
			<td>
				<p>All Alpha submissions must have an estimated capacity of greater than $250,000.</p>
