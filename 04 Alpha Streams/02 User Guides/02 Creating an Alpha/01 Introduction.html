<p>
To create an Alpha for the marketplace, you need just two principal components from the Framework:
</p>
	<ol>
		<li><b>A Universe Selection Model</b>, to determine the assets your Alpha will be trading; and
		<li>An Alpha Model, to generate Insight objects on selected assets.</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p>
		The rest of the Algorithm Framework (Portfolio Construction, Execution, and Risk Management) are related to position sizing and trade management and not relevant to an <i>external fund</i>. In this section, we will only cover creating an Alpha using the Algorithm Framework. If you have a Classic Algorithm, please see the documentation for <a href="/docs/alpha-streams/upgrading-classic-algorithms">Upgrading Classic Algorithms.</a>
	</p>

<p>
	All algorithms utilizing the QuantConnect Algorithm Framework are eligible for licensing in the Alpha Streams marketplace.
