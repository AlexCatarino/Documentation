<p>We deploy the Alphas that are accepted into the Alpha Streams Market to paper trading in order to produce the live trading results on the <a href="/docs/v2/alpha-streams/user-guides/_new/alpha-listings">Alpha listing</a> page. We simulate the live trading result with the <code>AlphaStreamsBrokerageModel</code>, so you may experience slightly different results when you deploy the Alpha with a real brokerage. We do not allocate capital to Alphas without <a href="/docs/v2/alpha-streams/user-guides/_new/investing">licensing the Alpha</a> and paying the Author like every other investor.</p>
