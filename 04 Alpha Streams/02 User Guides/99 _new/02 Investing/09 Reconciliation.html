<p>We score <a href='/docs/v2/our-platform/user-guides/live-trading/reconciliation'>reconciliation</a> with two metrics: returns correlation and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance. </p>

<h4>Returns Correlation</h4>
<p>Returns correlation is the simple Pearson correlation between the daily returns of the live deployment and the OOS backtest. The correlation is calculated as<br></p>

<img class='docs-image' style='max-height: 70px' src="https://cdn.quantconnect.com/i/tu/pearson-correlation-coefficient-formula.png">

<p>where <span class="latex-variable">X</span> and <span class="latex-variable">Y</span> are the daily returns of the live deployment and the OOS backtest, respectively. The return correlation measures the degree of the linear relationship between the daily returns of the live deployment and the OOS backtest. The correlation value provides us with a rudimentary understanding of how the returns move together. Do they trend up and down at the same time? Do they deviate in direction or timing?</p>


<p>The return correlation of your live and OSS backtest equity curves should be as close to 1 as possible. We consider a good score to be 0.8 or above, which means that has been a strong positive correlation. A high score indicates that the returns move together most of the time and that for any given return you see from one of the curves, the other curve usually has a similar direction return (positive or negative). It is valuable to understand the correlation of returns, but we also need another metric that provides an accurate 
comparison of the two equity curves.</p>

<h4>DTW Distance</h4>
<p>The similarity, or dissimilarity, of two time series is typically 
calculated using the 
Euclidean distance between adjacent points in vector space. The Euclidean distance is calculated as<br></p>

<p>where <span class="latex-variable">X</span> and <span class="latex-variable">Y</span> are the two vectors. If the two vectors are aligned, this calculation is reliable. Unfortunately, we often sample equity curves at irregular frequencies, even if they cover the same period. This irregular sampling renders Euclidian distance useless. Fortunately, there is a DTW algorithm that measures the similarity between two time series that may vary in sampling frequency. DTW calculates the optimal match between the two series with the smallest cost, which is given by a distance measurement. The smaller the DTW for two series, the more similar they are. A DTW of 0 means the two series are the same. Figure 1 shows the difference in how Euclidian and DTW distances are calculated.<br></p>

<p>DTW uses Euclidean distance as a measurement of point-to-point distance 
and returns an overall measurement of the distance that is on the scale of the 
initial time series values. We apply DTW to the daily returns of the 
live and OOS backtest, so the DTW distance measurement is on the 
scale of percent returns. We annualize the daily DTW because the annualized distance measures the annual difference in the magnitude of returns between the two equity curves. A DTW score of 0 is nearly impossible to achieve, so we consider anything below 0.2 to be a good score. A distance of 0.2 means the returns between your algorithm's live and OOS performance deviated by 20% over a year.</p>

<h4>Why We Need Returns Correlation and DTW Distance <br></h4>
<p>Returns correlation and DTW distance both provide insight into distinct elements of time series similarity, but neither measurement alone describes the whole picture. Returns correlation tells us if the daily returns of the live deployment and the OOS backtest move together, but it doesn't account for the possible differences in the magnitude of the returns. DTW distance measures the difference in magnitude of returns, but it doesn't provide insight into whether or not the returns move in the same direction.</p>

<p>It is possible for there to be two pairs of equity curves such that both pairs have the same DTW distance, but one pair has a daily return correlation of 1 and the other pair has a daily return correlation of -1. Similarly, it is possible for there to be two pairs of equity curves such that both have a daily return correlation of 1, but the pairs have different DTW distances. Having both metrics provides a more comprehensive understanding of the actual similarity between the live and OOS backtest performance.<br></p>
