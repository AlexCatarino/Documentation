<p>If you license an Alpha allocation, you can <a href="/docs/v2/alpha-streams/tutorials/investors/managing-deployments#02-Deploy-Alphas">deploy the Alpha to live trading</a> on co-located servers using the latest version of the Lean trading engine. The amount of capital in your brokerage account that you connect when deploying the Alpha must not exceed the allocation that you have licensed. If your brokerage account contains more capital than your Alpha allocation size, the deployment fails. To enable <a href="/docs/v2/our-platform/user-guides/live-trading/notifications">live trading notifications</a> on Alpha deployments, you need a subscription to the Alpha Analytics, S3, and API Bundle. Subscribe to the bundle on the <a href="/pricing">Pricing</a> page.</p>
