<p><a href="/docs/v2/alpha-streams/tutorials/authors/managing-alphas#02-Submit-New-Alphas">Submit your Alphas to the Alpha Streams team</a> to add them to the Alpha Streams Market. The List to Marketplace page in the Algorithm Lab can guide you through the process. Just select the backtest of the Alpha that you want to add to the market and then our automated tools scan your backtest to ensure it passes the <a href="/docs/v2/alpha-streams/user-guides/_new/alpha-life-cycle#02-Admission">admission requirements</a>. If your Alpha passes our admission requirements, you enter the details for the <a href="/docs/v2/alpha-streams/user-guides/_new/alpha-listings">Alpha listing page,</a> and then your listing is added to the queue for our Alpha Streams team to review.</p>
