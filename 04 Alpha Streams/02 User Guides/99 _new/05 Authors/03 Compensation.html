<p>If an investor licenses your Alpha, you receive 100% of the price bid by the investor. The investor also covers the 30% market fee and the cost of the datasets that the Alpha uses to make trading decisions. To view how we calculate the total costs, see&nbsp;<a href="/docs/v2/alpha-streams/user-guides/_new/investing#04-Bids">Bids</a>.<br></p>

<p>The minimum bid price is $3/month by default, but Authors can adjust the monthly reserve price. If the Alpha has not reached capacity, investors must bid at least the reserve price to be granted an allocation. If the Alpha has reached capacity, investors need to place higher bids to be granted an allocation at the <a href="/docs/v2/alpha-streams/user-guides/_new/investing#05-Auctions">monthly auction</a>.<br></p>

<p>The maximum amount that you can earn when your Alpha is added to the Alpha Streams Market is calculated as</p>

<p>For example, if your Alpha has a capacity of $100 million and you use the default reserve price of $3/month, then the maximum amount that you can earn for the first month of subscriptions is</p>

<p>This calculation assumes that all of your Alpha's capacity is licensed by investors. If in the following month, all of the investors want to keep their subscription and other investors want to get an allocation, they must bid a higher price than the $3/month, which will increase your earnings.</p>

<p>If an investor licenses your Alpha, you can <a href="/docs/v2/alpha-streams/tutorials/authors/managing-your-account#03-View-Transaction-History">view your earnings</a> in the Algorithm Lab. You can <a href="/docs/v2/alpha-streams/tutorials/authors/managing-your-account#04-Withdraw-Earnings">withdraw</a> the dollars in your QuantConnect Wallet or convert them to QuantConnect Credit. The funds are held for at least 2 weeks to allow investors to request refunds.</p>
