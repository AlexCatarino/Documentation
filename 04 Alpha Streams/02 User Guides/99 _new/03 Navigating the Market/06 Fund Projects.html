<p>The Fund Projects page displays detailed requests for Alpha from funds that are active in the QuantConnect ecosystem.</p>

<img class='img-responsive' src="https://cdn.quantconnect.com/i/tu/fund-projects.png">

<p>Each Fund Project includes a description of the Alpha that the fund is looking for, a list of requirements that the Alpha must meet, the Assets under management (AUM) of the fund, and the amount of the fund's AUM that is allocated to Alpha Streams. Refer to the Fund Projects page for ideas on the type of Alpha that funds are looking for in the Alpha Streams Market. If you control a fund and you want to create your own Fund Project, <a href="/funds">contact us</a>. Your Fund Project will motivate community members to develop the type of Alpha that you request.</p>
