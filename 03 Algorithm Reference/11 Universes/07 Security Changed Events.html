<p>
When universe contents are changed (securities are added or removed from the algorithm), we generate an $[OnSecuritiesChanged,T:QuantConnect.Data.UniverseSelection.SecurityChanges] event. This allows your algorithm to know the changes in the universe state. The event passes in the $[SecurityChanges] object containing references to the Added and Removed securities.
</p> 

<p>To monitor these events, you can bind to the $[OnSecuritiesChanged,M:QuantConnect.Algorithm.QCAlgorithm.OnSecuritiesChanged] Event handler:</p>

<div class="section-example-container" >
<pre class="csharp" >
public override void OnSecuritiesChanged(SecurityChanges changes)
{
    if (changes.AddedSecurities.Count > 0)
    {
        Debug("Securities added: " + 
              string.Join(",", changes.AddedSecurities.Select(x => x.Symbol.Value)));
    }
    if (changes.RemovedSecurities.Count > 0)
    {
        Debug("Securities removed: " + 
              string.Join(",", changes.RemovedSecurities.Select(x => x.Symbol.Value)));
    }
}
</pre>
<pre class="python" >
def OnSecuritiesChanged(self, changes):
    self._changes = changes
    self.Log(f"OnSecuritiesChanged({self.UtcTime}):: {changes}")
</pre>
</div>

<p>
These events are tracked automatically, and a list of current securities is provided by the <code>ActiveSecurities</code> property. This is a dictionary of Security objects which are currently in your universe. See more in the <a href="https://www.quantconnect.com/docs/algorithm-reference/securities-and-portfolio#Securities-and-Portfolio-Active-Securities">Securities and Portfolio</a> documentation.
