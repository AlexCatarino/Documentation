It's hard to achieve accurate portfolio allocations on smaller capital sizes where the price per share is larger than 
  the allocation percentage. This can be addressed by using fractional shares, but fractional share trading is only 
  supported by some brokerages. To get the closest results when backtesting and live-trading over the same period, 
  ensure both algorithms have the same starting cash balance.
