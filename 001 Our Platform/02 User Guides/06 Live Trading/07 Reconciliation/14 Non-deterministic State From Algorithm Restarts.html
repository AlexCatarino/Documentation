If a live algorithm is stopped and restarted during execution, it needs to restart in a stateful way to avoid 
  performance discrepancies. To restart in a stateful way, utilize the

  and 
  <a href="https://www.quantconnect.com/docs/algorithm-reference/historical-data#Historical-Data-History-Request-For-Known-Symbols">History</a>
   methods. Additionally, consider using the

  to save state information between live trading deployments.
